            "Although the second phase of the National Family Health Survey 2019-20 has gotten delayed because of the pandemic, the first phase data is now out and it makes for extremely sobering reading. There is cause for concern specifically on the malnutrition front, where most states have reported worsened indicators since NFHS 2015-16. For example the proportion of severely wasted children has gone up in 14 out of the 18 states (including the UT of J&K). Although its magnitude stands out in certain regions, the slippage is seen across rich and poor states.The pandemic has likely intensified this trend. Indeed it has so compounded the unemployment, poverty, hunger cycle across the globe that this year’s Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to the World Food Programme. In his acceptance speech executive director David Beasley highlighted how food is “the pathway to peace”. It is of course also the pathway to progress – with research suggesting that 90% of the brain grows by age five so that proper nutrition and stimulation in the early years can make future decades 50% more productive.There is a need for serious revaluation of India’s various nutrition schemes to understand why they are missing the mark. Underlying factors like women’s literacy and age at marriage or the family’s access to safe drinking water and sanitation could have as important a role as straightforward availability of provisions. Specific local factors would also be at play. Overall its endemicity also means that this is quite a complex equation to solve. But the task is crucial. It is not poetic licence to say that children are our future. A country where their bodies and brains are not properly nourished cannot hope to deliver on other development metrics like workforce productivity and economic growth.\n",

For it the idea that an adult human has many facets to her personality which may include nurturing and also sexual agency is too subversive. Ironically, Gandhi as a dutiful daughter-in-law and wife who has committed her life to her family’s values, fits conservative ideals of a woman’s role perfectly. This also helps explain why the rest of the country dismisses the sexist troll attacks on her as the fake news they are.\n",

            "There is palpable unease among scientists over Indian vaccine makers submitting their vaccines for emergency licences without publicly releasing the relevant data from trials. In sharp contrast, Pfizer, Moderna and Oxford-AstraZeneca sought emergency use authorisation only after publishing Phase 3 trial data on vaccine efficacy. Bharat Biotech hasn’t published Phase 1/2 safety and immunogenicity data for Covaxin yet. Serum Institute’s Covishield vaccine is similar to Oxford-AstraZeneca’s. But in a different tack, SII has reportedly preferred to approach the Drugs Controller General of India with interim data from the Phase 2 and 3 India trials.\n",
            "The hurry betrays a competitive, market-centric streak though allowances are made in life-threatening conditions for drugs demonstrating “remarkable efficacy” in early trials. This year’s health and economic exigencies are rightly forcing bureaucracies into accelerated approvals for public good. But the vaccine delivery phase has pitfalls that can endanger the attempt to reach herd immunity through inoculation. Companies must publish the data gleaned from trials, else regulator DCGI must prod them. Social media exercises unregulated command with authorities having limited control over fake news and misinformation that individual minds imbibe. Unlike trials, the information explosion from lakhs of inoculations will be staggering. Vaccines have side effects in some people, some too minor to register, others that disconcertingly last several hours.\n",
            "Social media’s tendency to amplify extreme views will put the adverse reactions on a viral trajectory, potentially inducing vaccine resistance. Unrelated deaths among persons with underlying health conditions could also get blamed on the vaccine. Combating this misinformation requires proactive communication, data sharing and transparency. Governments must be prepared to show deaths aren’t deviating from the normal and health workers must be mobilised to tackle misinformation. For this effort to succeed later, vaccine companies must lay a strong foundation now. They must publicly share the trial data for experts to offer informed opinion and citizens to make informed choices.\n",

            "There is palpable unease among scientists over Indian vaccine makers submitting their vaccines for emergency licences without publicly releasing the relevant data from trials. In sharp contrast, Pfizer, Moderna and Oxford-AstraZeneca sought emergency use authorisation only after publishing Phase 3 trial data on vaccine efficacy. Bharat Biotech hasn’t published Phase 1/2 safety and immunogenicity data for Covaxin yet. Serum Institute’s Covishield vaccine is similar to Oxford-AstraZeneca’s. But in a different tack, SII has reportedly preferred to approach the Drugs Controller General of India with interim data from the Phase 2 and 3 India trials.The hurry betrays a competitive, market-centric streak though allowances are made in life-threatening conditions for drugs demonstrating “remarkable efficacy” in early trials. This year’s health and economic exigencies are rightly forcing bureaucracies into accelerated approvals for public good. But the vaccine delivery phase has pitfalls that can endanger the attempt to reach herd immunity through inoculation. Companies must publish the data gleaned from trials, else regulator DCGI must prod them. Social media exercises unregulated command with authorities having limited control over fake news and misinformation that individual minds imbibe. Unlike trials, the information explosion from lakhs of inoculations will be staggering. Vaccines have side effects in some people, some too minor to register, others that disconcertingly last several hours.Social media’s tendency to amplify extreme views will put the adverse reactions on a viral trajectory, potentially inducing vaccine resistance. Unrelated deaths among persons with underlying health conditions could also get blamed on the vaccine. Combating this misinformation requires proactive communication, data sharing and transparency. Governments must be prepared to show deaths aren’t deviating from the normal and health workers must be mobilised to tackle misinformation. For this effort to succeed later, vaccine companies must lay a strong foundation now. They must publicly share the trial data for experts to offer informed opinion and citizens to make informed choices.\n",

Thus, even in Congress ruled states like Rajasthan, the party’s internal problems are providing an opening to BJP. This is truly an existential crisis for Congress.

            "Three companies developing vaccines for Covid-19 have approached India’s regulator CDSCO for emergency use authorisation. One of them, Pfizer/ BioNTech, which is using the unique mRNA platform to catalyse the body’s defence mechanism, has already received permission in the UK. The other two applicants are Indian vaccine maker Serum Institute working with AstraZeneca and Oxford University, and Bharat Biotech co-developing the indigenous vaccine Covaxin with ICMR. This is the most hopeful development in a long while. We are now on the threshold of the next stage in the battle against coronavirus, which should enable the return to normalcy.\n",
            "Serum has indicated to the media that it expects to supply its vaccines to both the government and the private sector. Distribution through all available channels is important. It will enable speed of vaccination, which must be the top priority henceforth. This is because vaccination has a non-linear or disproportionately large impact in the battle against Covid. Anyone can become a super-spreader. Therefore, the faster the vaccination exercise is rolled out, the greater the level of protection for the entire country.\n",
            "There are at least eight vaccine candidates in different stages of clinical trials in India. The government, with its existing distribution infrastructure to annually vaccinate more than 30 million children and pregnant women under the Universal Immunisation Programme, will naturally be the key player. It’s only natural that most of the Covid vaccination under this will be fully or at least partially subsidised. To both concentrate government’s scarce resources where they’re needed and to spread the net of safety, a market system of vaccination should be allowed to work in the private sector. Ready availability there will also lessen malfeasance in the subsidised public sector distribution chain.\n",

            "Three companies developing vaccines for Covid-19 have approached India’s regulator CDSCO for emergency use authorisation. One of them, Pfizer/ BioNTech, which is using the unique mRNA platform to catalyse the body’s defence mechanism, has already received permission in the UK. The other two applicants are Indian vaccine maker Serum Institute working with AstraZeneca and Oxford University, and Bharat Biotech co-developing the indigenous vaccine Covaxin with ICMR. This is the most hopeful development in a long while. We are now on the threshold of the next stage in the battle against coronavirus, which should enable the return to normalcy.Serum has indicated to the media that it expects to supply its vaccines to both the government and the private sector. Distribution through all available channels is important. It will enable speed of vaccination, which must be the top priority henceforth. This is because vaccination has a non-linear or disproportionately large impact in the battle against Covid. Anyone can become a super-spreader. Therefore, the faster the vaccination exercise is rolled out, the greater the level of protection for the entire country.There are at least eight vaccine candidates in different stages of clinical trials in India. The government, with its existing distribution infrastructure to annually vaccinate more than 30 million children and pregnant women under the Universal Immunisation Programme, will naturally be the key player. It’s only natural that most of the Covid vaccination under this will be fully or at least partially subsidised. To both concentrate government’s scarce resources where they’re needed and to spread the net of safety, a market system of vaccination should be allowed to work in the private sector. Ready availability there will also lessen malfeasance in the subsidised public sector distribution chain.The Centre and states may have had an extraordinarily tough job on hand when the Covid pandemic hit the country in March. But the manner in which the initial lockdown was handled, as well as the almost chaotic approach of states subsequently, reflected poorly on India’s governance quality. Authorities need to get it right this time, as the next phase will require even greater coordination between the Centre and states. This is essential to reducing the suffering and restoring economic normalcy quickly, thereby making some restitution for a lost year.

The government too has to do better on policy making as that influences the quality and spread of network infrastructure. Digitalisation of payments does call for a greater level of sophistication on the part of all stakeholders as easy access and speed can also work in the wrong direction.

Digital payments for retail transactions are fast gaining popularity. The share of digital transactions in the total volume of non-cash retail payments was 97% in 2019-20. RBI’s announcements on digital payments came in the backdrop of a regulatory restriction on an expansion in HDFC Bank’s digital plans following three outages since 2018. As RBI governor Shaktikanta Das explained, it is important to maintain public confidence in digital banking. There is no denying that.Digital banking has to overcome two challenges to gain currency. It needs to provide convenience without compromising either safety or privacy. Given the surge in digital transactions that has accompanied the mobile phone revolution, both financial intermediaries and the regulator have to up their game. The government too has to do better on policy making as that influences the quality and spread of network infrastructure. Digitalisation of payments does call for a greater level of sophistication on the part of all stakeholders as easy access and speed can also work in the wrong direction. India is at a critical juncture in this matter. It’s no longer a question of incentivising digital transactions. It’s about improving services and bolstering confidence.\n",

            "With the UK approving a Covid-19 vaccine and the US and the EU in advanced stages of doing the same, Indians are wondering when our turn will come. The Pfizer vaccine that has gotten the UK authorisation and the Moderna one that is close on its heels do not look feasible for India in the near future. While it is true that using cutting edge mRNA technology these two projects have shown outstanding results in the trials so far, they have not been tested in India, they are expensive and their cold chain requirements are onerous. And currently there is no plan for their manufacture for India.Our best bet right now is the Oxford-AstroZeneca vaccine that is being tested in India. Early results of the UK and Brazil trials are not as outstanding as those of Pfizer and Moderna but they meet the efficacy standards, and an emergency approval is possible based on these. Indeed the Serum Institute of India which is partnering with Oxford-AstroZeneca for the manufacture of this vaccine for India. It is possible that this vaccine becomes available in the country very early in the new year.Read also: In talks with India on opportunity to roll out vaccine: PfizerAmong indigenous candidates the one in the lead is Covaxin, which is being developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research. Phase-3 trials have begun. Trial results are expected in early 2021 and the vaccine could be ready for distribution by next June. In sum, we may have to wait a little bit more than the rich world for the vaccine but we will also get there. Until then, chin up, masks on.\n",

            "The UK has become the first country in the world to approve a fully tested Covid-19 vaccine, made jointly by the American pharma giant Pfizer and a smaller German firm BioNTech, with inoculations expected to become available there from “next week”. Pfizer has also applied for emergency authorisation in the US, as has Moderna, another American company, which has co-developed its candidate with NIH. And in India SII, which has been testing the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, has said it will apply for an emergency approval in two weeks. This truly is vaccine development at “pandemic speed”, highlighting how governments and other stakeholders have indeed made fighting Covid the top priority.\n",

When the world is set for the worst recession since the Depression and the children are beginning to forget what school felt like, and the vaccine is the brahmastra to return us to normality, crunching everything from funding to regulatory approvals into almost unimaginable timelines is very sensible, perhaps even heroic. It must also be underlined that unlike China and Russia which authorised the use of some vaccines without waiting for the results of phase-3 trials, the above mentioned projects have not skipped any of the necessary steps, and their findings have also been opened to independent verification.\n",
            "On adverse events, which are unexpected medical problems that occur during drug treatment, it must be understood that they are an unavoidable part of vaccine science. What is important is to identify whether there is a causal relationship between the vaccine agent and the adverse event, and to do this as per objective criteria. Of course even if the adverse event is found to be unconnected to the vaccine, it is important to fully take care of the concerned patient. This is basic bioethics. This is also essential to safeguard citizens’ faith in clinical trials, as well as continued participation in them. On all these complex issues, governments, regulators and vaccine makers must recognise the utmost importance of effective communication with the public. Don’t let misinformation and distrust undermine the good work of science.\n",
            "Vaccine rollouts will of course usher in a new set of challenges. To make the best of the warp speed labours of the scientists, different levels of government in India must work together on businesslike plans to distribute vaccines right upto the panchayat level.\n",

Second, since Trudeau is keen to certify the “peaceful” character of the farm protests, it’s an interesting question how his government would have reacted if, say, protesters had moved to block all entry routes to Ottawa. Would Trudeau have instructed Canadian law enforcement to stand aside, and allow the blockade to proceed?

            "The GDP data for the second quarter of 2020-21 conveys a mixed picture. GDP shrank 7.5% to Rs 33.14 lakh crore. This is the first recession, or two successive quarters of contraction, since quarterly data became available. But the decline is lower than the 9.8% forecast by RBI in its monetary policy last month. To that extent, the silver lining is that the recovery from the first quarter’s contraction of 23.9% is a bit better than expected. Granular data however shows that the economy remains in a bad shape. This really calls for smart intervention by the Centre.\n",
            "Strength of private consumption is an important economic indicator. It is the largest component of GDP and it fell in the second quarter by 11.3% to Rs 17.96 lakh crore. This is telling of what has happened to the purchasing power of consumers. There is little doubt that the pandemic induced economic collapse, coming of course on the heels of two successive years of an economic slowdown, has resulted in serious damage. It’s only agriculture which has largely escaped damage, which means it’s imperative the government address anxiety over agricultural reforms before this hurts the sector.\n",
            "Since the lockdown was imposed in the last week of March, the government has also got cracking on pending reforms in factor markets such as labour and has designed packages to encourage manufacturing competitiveness. These reforms are largely aimed at removing bottlenecks which restrain the supply side of the economy. The implicit assumption is that reforms will catalyse private investment and set off a virtuous cycle. There is a catch here. A significant part of the private investment will be influenced by the strength of domestic demand. Hence, the Atmanirbhar Bharat idea spelt out by Prime Minister Narendra Modi included domestic demand as one of its pillars.\n",
            "The immediate task is for the government to address weak domestic demand. Many of the supply side measures will fulfil their potential only if there are clear signs of a revival in domestic demand. This calls for shuffling of prioritisation, if necessary, to focus on revival of domestic demand. Even if the government does not want to expand its borrowing programme in the residual four months of the financial year, there are other ways to revive purchasing power. For example, hastening execution of its existing infrastructure projects needs top priority as this will address the current economic challenges.\n",

Granular data however shows that the economy remains in a bad shape. This really calls for smart intervention by the Centre.Strength of private consumption is an important economic indicator. It is the largest component of GDP and it fell in the second quarter by 11.3% to Rs 17.96 lakh crore. This is telling of what has happened to the purchasing power of consumers. There is little doubt that the pandemic induced economic collapse, coming of course on the heels of two successive years of an economic slowdown, has resulted in serious damage. It’s only agriculture which has largely escaped damage, which means it’s imperative the government address anxiety over agricultural reforms before this hurts the sector.Since the lockdown was imposed in the last week of March, the government has also got cracking on pending reforms in factor markets such as labour and has designed packages to encourage manufacturing competitiveness. These reforms are largely aimed at removing bottlenecks which restrain the supply side of the economy. The implicit assumption is that reforms will catalyse private investment and set off a virtuous cycle. There is a catch here. A significant part of the private investment will be influenced by the strength of domestic demand. Hence, the Atmanirbhar Bharat idea spelt out by Prime Minister Narendra Modi included domestic demand as one of its pillars.The immediate task is for the government to address weak domestic demand. Many of the supply side measures will fulfil their potential only if there are clear signs of a revival in domestic demand. This calls for shuffling of prioritisation, if necessary, to focus on revival of domestic demand. Even if the government does not want to expand its borrowing programme in the residual four months of the financial year, there are other ways to revive purchasing power. For example, hastening execution of its existing infrastructure projects needs top priority as this will address the current economic challenges.\n",

            "Union government’s unhappiness with some states not cooperating with central schemes underscores the importance of better Centre-state relations. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is reported to have flagged Maharashtra’s slow progress on the bullet train project and the failure of some states to enrol street vendors for the PM-SVANidhi microfinance scheme. Differences of opinion have always persisted between Centre’s developmental vision which is generally holistic, and state governments having their own local imperatives and funding priorities. Politics also plays its part, with states governed by parties different from the Centre more likely to voice objections.\n",
            "The bullet train impasse stems from the Maha Vikas Aghadi government unwilling to expend political capital on the project, over which the alliance partners had expressed misgivings while in opposition. Frequent run-ins between BJP and MVA constituents aren’t helping either. An extensive network of bullet trains enabled China to speed up its growth. Unfortunately, India is failing here and blame lies with the politics of demonisation, which no side is immune from. The enviable bullet train network across China’s length and breadth and India’s snail paced progress on Mumbai-Ahmedabad high speed rail corridor and Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor could be used as metaphors for the development trajectory of the two countries.\n",
            "A revival act depends on the Centre conjuring up the original spirit of cooperative federalism, that saw such steps as the 2015 approval of the 14th Finance Commission recommendation devolving 42% of tax receipts to states. But non-shareable cesses and surcharges in the central kitty have remained beyond the pale of this 42% devolution. Meanwhile, public debt of states as percentage of GDP spiked between 2014-15 and 2019-20 while Centre’s declined during this period. States must take the onus for fiscal responsibility, but they are just as likely to blame inadequate tax devolution and GST compensation for their plight.\n",
            "Now the recession is forcing states to cut expenditure with development spending taking large hits. Greater Centre-state coordination is needed now. Besides funds, it requires mitigating political mistrust, at its peak with central agencies actively pursuing only non-BJP leaders and opposition governments fearing for their stability. Brinkmanship over cornering credit for schemes hurts too: Andhra CM Jagan Reddy has renamed the PM-SVANidhi after himself. BJP’s domination of the political and economic narrative, evident from the Bihar results, should put the party at ease. Cordial Centre-state relations can elevate economy and development instead of culture wars and partisan politics as national obsessions.\n",

            "Union government’s unhappiness with some states not cooperating with central schemes underscores the importance of better Centre-state relations. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is reported to have flagged Maharashtra’s slow progress on the bullet train project and the failure of some states to enrol street vendors for the PM-SVANidhi microfinance scheme. Differences of opinion have always persisted between Centre’s developmental vision which is generally holistic, and state governments having their own local imperatives and funding priorities. Politics also plays its part, with states governed by parties different from the Centre more likely to voice objections.The bullet train impasse stems from the Maha Vikas Aghadi government unwilling to expend political capital on the project, over which the alliance partners had expressed misgivings while in opposition. Frequent run-ins between BJP and MVA constituents aren’t helping either. An extensive network of bullet trains enabled China to speed up its growth. Unfortunately, India is failing here and blame lies with the politics of demonisation, which no side is immune from. The enviable bullet train network across China’s length and breadth and India’s snail paced progress on Mumbai-Ahmedabad high speed rail corridor and Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor could be used as metaphors for the development trajectory of the two countries.A revival act depends on the Centre conjuring up the original spirit of cooperative federalism, that saw such steps as the 2015 approval of the 14th Finance Commission recommendation devolving 42% of tax receipts to states. But non-shareable cesses and surcharges in the central kitty have remained beyond the pale of this 42% devolution. Meanwhile, public debt of states as percentage of GDP spiked between 2014-15 and 2019-20 while Centre’s declined during this period. States must take the onus for fiscal responsibility, but they are just as likely to blame inadequate tax devolution and GST compensation for their plight.Now the recession is forcing states to cut expenditure with development spending taking large hits. Greater Centre-state coordination is needed now. Besides funds, it requires mitigating political mistrust, at its peak with central agencies actively pursuing only non-BJP leaders and opposition governments fearing for their stability. Brinkmanship over cornering credit for schemes hurts too: Andhra CM Jagan Reddy has renamed the PM-SVANidhi after himself. BJP’s domination of the political and economic narrative, evident from the Bihar results, should put the party at ease. Cordial Centre-state relations can elevate economy and development instead of culture wars and partisan politics as national obsessions.\n",

To build on this and hasten India’s transition to an energy economy less dependent on fossil fuels, we need to address challenges that lie ahead. China has played an important part in the ramp up of solar capacity as it is a large supplier of solar cells.

The falling tariffs have also adversely affected projects initiated earlier where the tariff is higher as cash strapped states look for ways to lower costs.

            "The goods and services tax (GST) architecture today faces two challenges. One, is the trust deficit between the Centre and states which can delay the inclusion of key industrial inputs such as electricity from being brought under GST. Consequently, there is a break in the chain which limits the potential benefit of GST. The second challenge is the inadequate backend preparation prior to the launch which has prevented the advent of a smooth and non-intrusive supervision mechanism.The Law Commission of the GST Council recently made a set of recommendations to tackle the second challenge. The positive recommendations seek to use information technology and analytics to zero in on possible tax fraud coming through fake invoices to claim input tax credit. With growing digitisation this is the best way forward. It can also be made to mesh with other measures that need to be taken to plug the gaps in the technology backbone.GST frauds may force govt to turn to inspectors againThe GST Council must however avoid measures that increase the cost of doing business. Any measure which blocks tax credit to firms while the government checks for reliability will only choke the system. For the economy, the need now is a smoother flow of transactions even as the government improves its technology backbone to make administration less intrusive.\n",

The state’s Left government has cited rising complaints of cyber bullying of women and children and failure to restrain accused persons under existing provisions. The claim of statutory vacuum is unfounded: Ample provisions in the IPC and POCSO Act exist to tackle these abuses. The law’s phrasing leaves little doubt that apart from lip service to punishing abusive behaviour, it also offers a handy tool to silence critics.\n",

The news media, which reports on government functioning, official irregularities or political developments is rendered particularly vulnerable by such widely defined and subjective provisions. Recall that Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, which had criminalised “offensive communication causing annoyance, inconvenience, danger, obstruction, insult, injury” etc, led to several ordinary citizens being jailed for dissent before the Supreme Court struck it down.\n",

The latter allows a police officer to register an FIR, begin a probe and make arrests even on grounds like someone being humiliated or defamed or faced “injury to the mind or reputation”. This is draconian, far exceeding the IPC provision on criminal defamation, which puts the onus for lodging complaints on a defamed victim, not police. Even for serious offences the ordinance is superfluous: IPC provisions for criminal intimidation, stalking and sexual harassment adequately deal with “threatening and abusive” behaviour.\n",
            "This penchant for legislating new laws while neglecting existing ones is a peculiar Indian trait. The solution for police failure to address vicious cyberbullying or cyberstalking is to improve responsiveness and technological capabilities. The LDF government’s shrinking political capital amid multiple central agency probes and inability to control the media narrative may explain the timing. Assent from the governor, a central appointee, is evidence that neither Left nor Right have much patience for dissent or parliamentary scrutiny.

            "Every year devotees celebrate Chhath Puja by offering prayers to the Sun as they take a dip in a river. But the pandemic this year has led several states to restrict celebrations in public places for this festival, just has been the case for several other festivals. Unfortunately, instead of coming together in collective interest, politics has been pushing the dilution of Covid protocols for the festival.This confrontation saw Jharkhand for example first disallow and then allow congregations and religious ceremonies on the banks of rivers, ponds and other public water bodies. In Delhi also the opposition BJP has pushed for a similar U-turn despite the capital battling its worst Covid peak. As the Delhi high court said in response to a petition contesting the restrictions on religious grounds, “You have to be alive first to celebrate rituals of any religion. Are you not aware of the coronavirus situation in Delhi?”Although recent days have seen good news on vaccine development by different companies, it is very clear that in reality it will take a long time for big populations like India to be vaccinated in full. It is therefore imperative that citizens and governments and political parties alike stop resisting the ‘new normal’, where all activities are adapted to Covid protocols.\n",

            "With November bringing encouraging results on vaccine trials, focus must now shift to rapidly expand the infrastructure needed for vaccine delivery. Ongoing Phase 3 trials of the cutting edge mRNA vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna are pointing to efficacy rates as high as 95%. Russia has also claimed nearly similar effectiveness for its Sputnik V vaccine in late stage trials. One Chinese vaccine candidate CoronaVac has passed early trials for safe, adequate immune response amid concerns over lower levels of neutralising antibody presence compared to recovered Covid patients.\n",
            "So far India has booked 1.6 billion doses with Novavax-SII, Oxford-AstraZeneca-SII whose Phase 3 trial results are expected soon, and Gamaleya Institute which developed Sputnik V. Indian companies like Bharat Biotech and Zydus Cadila are also in the race. While the fast progress in trials is a morale booster, a long timeline for vaccinating the general population beckons. Prioritisation for health staff and other vulnerable groups and ramping up production facilities and cold chains could stagger the process in India. During the interim, improvements in treatment protocols are key to reducing mortality.\n",
            "Like mRNA, which was originally developed for targeting cancer cells, research has focussed on repurposing existing drugs. Though the early promise held out by some antiparasitic and antiviral drugs has faded, drugs for treating multiple sclerosis, arthritis, depression and some monoclonal antibodies are showing promise in reducing mortality. Drafting these drugs and more international vaccine candidates for trials must be considered. Admittedly, the challenge India faces with mRNA vaccines is the extreme cold chain temperatures and their high price. Yet that shouldn’t stop trials, given the novelty of the technology. Replicating vaccine and drug trials domestically may pass on the benefits to patients besides bolstering research and training local pharma capabilities on the anti-Covid effort.\n",
            "Meanwhile, there is no room for complacency despite the impending vaccines. The ongoing global spurt of infections this winter is likely the biggest crisis moment in the pandemic. Delhi’s current hospital and ICU bed situations are behind the curve. A national spike of similar scale could overpower states with poor public health capacity. With lockdowns no more an option, governments must keep several balls up in the air: bolstering reliable testing, ICU bed capacity, vaccine logistics and the economy. Citizens must do their part too: by exercising caution and good sense in their social interactions by face masking and physical distancing.\n",

Clearly there is a fundamental difference between Johnson and Trump in their approaches to science, notwithstanding their being clubbed together as populist leaders.

But a pushback by industry and fears of job losses forced it to climb down. Without government investing in EV infrastructure upfront, passing the buck to industry won’t work. Nonetheless, EVs are the future and a concrete transition plan is needed. India should work with the UK and synergise EV development. The two sides can even jointly produce for the world market.

            "President-elect Joe Biden has begun following up on the many congratulatory messages from world leaders. On Tuesday night he called Prime Minister Narendra Modi, after which the latter tweeted that they had discussed shared priorities and concerns, namely the Covid-19 pandemic, climate change and cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region. The readout from the Biden side further mentions “launching the global economic recovery” as well as “strengthening democracy at home and abroad”.This conversation comes in the context of speculation that the Modi administration had put too many eggs in the Trump basket, which would hurt India given the Biden win, especially as the latter would not give India a free pass on Kashmir, CAA etc. These fears are overblown. Geopolitical winds ensure continuity in the India-US relationship. The signing of the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) in October for example speaks to a defence interoperability between the two sides that is here to stay.Read also: PM speaks to US President-elect Joe Biden, congratulates him for his winA less transactional US presidency could also see progress for India on the trade front.

            "Loud signals of BJP’s plans for Nitish Kumar can be read in the exit of Sushil Modi, anchor of the long JD(U)-BJP partnership in Bihar. Nitish’s concern for his secular image required Sushil to keep local BJP leaders on a tight leash and ensure a constant channel of communication with the CM. Now that JD(U) has slipped to junior partner in the alliance, with just 43 seats against BJP’s 74, BJP’s easing out of Sushil is ample indication to Nitish that the equations have flipped. Henceforth, it will be BJP calling the shots and the CM’s post to Nitish may be among the few concessions on offer.\n",
            "Honourably accommodated as CM, the gambit leaves Nitish with little legroom to exit NDA as he did in 2013 after failing to prevent Narendra Modi’s rise. Nitish would also recognise that his shifting loyalties to UPA in 2015 and back to NDA in 2017 have eroded his political credibility. Another flight to RJD’s side if BJP boxes him into a corner could be suicidal for JD(U) and may invite a rebellion within its ranks. Moreover, Nitish has no reason to assume that RJD will be any less covetous than BJP in the pursuit of power or a chunk of  EBC-Mahadalit votes that Nitish snatched away from Lalu Prasad.\n",
            "The choice of OBC-EBC leaders Tarkishore Prasad and Renu Devi, to replace Sushil, barely disguises BJP’s plans for 2025. If Nitish vacates the political field by then as he promised to voters on the last day of campaigning, BJP will need recognisable backward class faces in Bihar’s notoriously stratified caste society.

            "Loud signals of BJP’s plans for Nitish Kumar can be read in the exit of Sushil Modi, anchor of the long JD(U)-BJP partnership in Bihar. Nitish’s concern for his secular image required Sushil to keep local BJP leaders on a tight leash and ensure a constant channel of communication with the CM. Now that JD(U) has slipped to junior partner in the alliance, with just 43 seats against BJP’s 74, BJP’s easing out of Sushil is ample indication to Nitish that the equations have flipped. Henceforth, it will be BJP calling the shots and the CM’s post to Nitish may be among the few concessions on offer.Honourably accommodated as CM, the gambit leaves Nitish with little legroom to exit NDA as he did in 2013 after failing to prevent Narendra Modi’s rise. Nitish would also recognise that his shifting loyalties to UPA in 2015 and back to NDA in 2017 have eroded his political credibility. Another flight to RJD’s side if BJP boxes him into a corner could be suicidal for JD(U) and may invite a rebellion within its ranks. Moreover, Nitish has no reason to assume that RJD will be any less covetous than BJP in the pursuit of power or a chunk of  EBC-Mahadalit votes that Nitish snatched away from Lalu Prasad.The choice of OBC-EBC leaders Tarkishore Prasad and Renu Devi, to replace Sushil, barely disguises BJP’s plans for 2025. If Nitish vacates the political field by then as he promised to voters on the last day of campaigning, BJP will need recognisable backward class faces in Bihar’s notoriously stratified caste society. So far, Nitish brought this section to NDA. A strong RJD eyeing the same vote implies that BJP must woo this social segment with or without JD(U) in tow.JD(U)’s future has thus far been strongly aligned to Nitish after George Fernandes faded away and Nitish prevailed in two closely fought assembly elections in 2005.

This gravity defying performance in the midst of a contraction in overall economic growth holds lessons for all states and the Centre. Prior to this period, the Maharashtra government reduced stamp duty on the purchase and sale of property. The state government deserves credit for initiating a bold measure in the backdrop of a severe resource crunch. This measure synchronised with the monetary stimulus unleashed by RBI and created a favourable environment for real estate transactions.\n",
            "Stamp duty in Maharashtra, which is levied when the relevant documents are registered with the state, was lowered from 5% to 2% for the period between September and December. It is to go up by a percentage point in the subsequent quarter. There are two takeaways here. When transaction costs are high, it dampens business. Such a situation helps no one. In addition, high transaction costs encourage subterfuge to evade state levies. In other words, they catalyse black money. The reduction in stamp duty, along with other factors such as low interest rates, have delivered in a bleak environment.\n",
            "This example also goes to show that instead of heavy handed measures such as demonetisation, reforming India’s tax architecture will do more to bring transactions into the tax net. Ease of tax compliance and reasonable rates are non-disruptive ways to achieve multiple goals. The reduction in stamp duty also nudged potential buyers to go ahead with their plans instead of postponing them. Another factor which created a favourable environment was that a measure taken by the state government was in sync with the Centre’s policy approach. Given that in a federal structure power is dispersed, a reform can deliver only if everyone is on the same page.\n",

If tax reforms are designed with the primary emphasis on quickening economic momentum, the efficacy of reforms will be greater. In this context, Maharashtra should avoid going back to its old stamp duty rate at the end of the financial year. The experience of the last few months shows that the state exchequer will benefit more from lower rates. Moreover, an increase in construction activity will ripple out into the larger economy.\n",

The situation was worse when it came to capital spending, which at Rs 1.65 lakh crore is lower by 13%.

In September, the government finalised its borrowing plan for the year and has since signalled that it’s disinclined to top up. This means that most of the changes announced represent a shift in prioritisation of spending for the year, or calibration of the existing schemes to allow for greater synchronisation with RBI’s monetary stimulus. In this context, measures to incentivise real estate sales and add to the list of stressed sectors eligible for credit support make sense.The flexibility of response in response to an unprecedented situation is welcome. But the slow pace of government spending when private demand has shrunk is a puzzle. Data from the Controller General of Accounts shows that at the end of the first half of the financial year, total government expenditure at Rs 14.79 lakh crore was lower than the previous year in absolute terms. The situation was worse when it came to capital spending, which at Rs 1.65 lakh crore is lower by 13%. In the wake of a collapse in aggregate demand, what really counts is the government’s failure to step up its spending to partially offset it.\n",

The disengagement plan was agreed upon by the two armies as a follow-up to the eighth round of corps commander level talks. As per the plan, the disengagement is likely to begin from the north bank of Pangong Tso, where the PLA has occupied and fortified the 8km stretch from Finger 4 to 8 since May.\n",
            "Read: India, China to dismantle new structures built after April-May timeframe under disengagement plans\n",
            "PLA troops will withdraw to their positions east of Finger 8 while Indian soldiers will pull back to their Dhan Singh Thapa post between Finger 2 and 3. The stretch between Finger 4 and Finger 8 is then to be designated as a no-patrol zone. Concurrently, the two armies are supposed to withdraw their tanks and heavy weaponry to depth areas from forward locations on the south bank of Pangong Tso and vacate previously unoccupied Chushul heights.\n",
            "However, the Indian side would do well to distrust and verify the disengagement plan. We have been here before as an earlier disengagement plan had gone horribly wrong, leading to clashes in which 20 Indian soldiers and an unspecified number of Chinese troops were killed in the Galwan Valley. A repeat of this must be avoided at all costs. Plus, it is clear that China is looking to push the LAC westward. The disengagement plan of  creating a no-patrolling zone is consistent with this. Therefore, we must continue to be alert to thwart any Chinese salami slicing tactics in the future.\n",

            "In signs that India and China are close to a pullback from the Pangong Tso-Chushul friction points in eastern Ladakh, both sides are working on modalities to withdraw troops, tanks and armoured vehicles from the area. The disengagement plan was agreed upon by the two armies as a follow-up to the eighth round of corps commander level talks. As per the plan, the disengagement is likely to begin from the north bank of Pangong Tso, where the PLA has occupied and fortified the 8km stretch from Finger 4 to 8 since May.Read: India, China to dismantle new structures built after April-May timeframe under disengagement plansPLA troops will withdraw to their positions east of Finger 8 while Indian soldiers will pull back to their Dhan Singh Thapa post between Finger 2 and 3. The stretch between Finger 4 and Finger 8 is then to be designated as a no-patrol zone. Concurrently, the two armies are supposed to withdraw their tanks and heavy weaponry to depth areas from forward locations on the south bank of Pangong Tso and vacate previously unoccupied Chushul heights.However, the Indian side would do well to distrust and verify the disengagement plan. We have been here before as an earlier disengagement plan had gone horribly wrong, leading to clashes in which 20 Indian soldiers and an unspecified number of Chinese troops were killed in the Galwan Valley. A repeat of this must be avoided at all costs. Plus, it is clear that China is looking to push the LAC westward. The disengagement plan of  creating a no-patrolling zone is consistent with this. Therefore, we must continue to be alert to thwart any Chinese salami slicing tactics in the future.We have to acknowledge that the strategic tussle with China will last for a long time. Growing the economy, rapidly modernising our military and stitching up alliances with the West are our best bets.\n",

For India, that means traditional cold storage and supply systems need to be upgraded, as the bulk of these are presently used for agriculture produce. Aside from the issue of switching over to heavy-duty cold chains, India hasn’t even reserved any doses with Pfizer. Nor is Pfizer part of WHO’s Covax distribution programme. Thus, the government must quickly evaluate how to obtain the frontrunner Covid vaccine. Let bureaucracy not hold up a shot that can potentially control the Covid scourge.\n",

            "The Haryana assembly has just passed a Bill that reserves 75% of factory and other jobs for locals. This is a great leap backwards. It follows similar steps taken by other states such as Andhra Pradesh. Even after accounting for India’s political climate of mindless populism, this is a disastrous move. It undermines the potential of Gurgaon, the economic engine of the state. Neither does it help the state in developing newer industrial clusters. It reflects very poorly on the leadership of chief minister ML Khattar.\n",
            "A requirement of the Bill is that new jobs with a salary below Rs 50,000 will be reserved for locals. This is a recipe for the flight of jobs out of the state. India’s average annual per capita income is Rs 1.34 lakh. But Haryana wants to reserve jobs with an annual pay of up to Rs 6 lakh, which includes blue collar as well as many white collar workers. If industry doesn’t flee the state as a result, legal loopholes will be found to keep people off the rolls. In the process job seekers will lose out on the benefits of formalisation of jobs. It’s a lose-lose situation for all stakeholders.\n",
            "Prime Minister Narendra Modi has worked hard to persuade global industry that India presents an ideal investment opportunity. Legislation has been amended to ease the regulatory environment and impart flexibility to labour markets. But if state governments move in the opposite direction, Modi’s effort will have been in vain. Haryana’s reservation of jobs thus undermines the Centre’s efforts. It sends a negative signal to global investors on account of Gurgaon’s prominence. Most of all, it hurts the very people it pretends to help. For the good of the state as well as in the larger national interest, Haryana must reverse this disastrous move.\n",

            "The Haryana assembly has just passed a Bill that reserves 75% of factory and other jobs for locals. This is a great leap backwards. It follows similar steps taken by other states such as Andhra Pradesh. Even after accounting for India’s political climate of mindless populism, this is a disastrous move. It undermines the potential of Gurgaon, the economic engine of the state. Neither does it help the state in developing newer industrial clusters. It reflects very poorly on the leadership of chief minister ML Khattar.A requirement of the Bill is that new jobs with a salary below Rs 50,000 will be reserved for locals. This is a recipe for the flight of jobs out of the state. India’s average annual per capita income is Rs 1.34 lakh. But Haryana wants to reserve jobs with an annual pay of up to Rs 6 lakh, which includes blue collar as well as many white collar workers. If industry doesn’t flee the state as a result, legal loopholes will be found to keep people off the rolls. In the process job seekers will lose out on the benefits of formalisation of jobs. It’s a lose-lose situation for all stakeholders.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has worked hard to persuade global industry that India presents an ideal investment opportunity. Legislation has been amended to ease the regulatory environment and impart flexibility to labour markets. But if state governments move in the opposite direction, Modi’s effort will have been in vain. Haryana’s reservation of jobs thus undermines the Centre’s efforts. It sends a negative signal to global investors on account of Gurgaon’s prominence. Most of all, it hurts the very people it pretends to help. For the good of the state as well as in the larger national interest, Haryana must reverse this disastrous move.\n",

Twinning laws and enforcement with awareness and promotion will do the trick.

            "The candidature of Kamala Harris has put a historic spotlight on Indian-Americans in the US. This is not a large vote bank, at around 1% of the country’s population. But the nature of the 2020 contest has made it worth wooing hard, by both Democrats and Republicans. As Joe Biden wrote in an oped, it can make “all the difference from North Carolina and Virginia to Pennsylvania and Michigan to Georgia and Texas”. In other words, it can give a critical nudge in the swing states. To illustrate, there are 61,000 Indian-American voters in Pennsylvania, a state which Donald Trump won by less than 45,000 votes last time, and which is close to being a must-win for him this time.\n",
            "Overall these voters tilt blue, with the Indian American Attitudes Survey finding that 72% of them plan to vote for Biden and 22% for Trump. The combination of being brown and very well-educated is predictive of this tilt, with 47% of Indian-American citizens classifying themselves on the liberal spectrum as compared to 23% on the conservative one. From press freedoms to the Black Lives Matter movement, liberal attitudes dominate especially among those born in America.\n",
            "For long the model minority tag of the community also signified that they didn’t adventure beyond professions like engineering, medicine or academics. But over time they have become far likelier to get involved in politics as compared to other Asian groups. Many of them now staff Capitol Hill and this election may also see the Samosa Caucus, collective nickname for Indian-American lawmakers in Congress, grow larger. If Harris does indeed become the first woman vice-president of the US, that would give strong new momentum to the diaspora’s political ambitions up and down the tickets. But the trend is already here.\n",

            "The candidature of Kamala Harris has put a historic spotlight on Indian-Americans in the US. This is not a large vote bank, at around 1% of the country’s population. But the nature of the 2020 contest has made it worth wooing hard, by both Democrats and Republicans. As Joe Biden wrote in an oped, it can make “all the difference from North Carolina and Virginia to Pennsylvania and Michigan to Georgia and Texas”. In other words, it can give a critical nudge in the swing states. To illustrate, there are 61,000 Indian-American voters in Pennsylvania, a state which Donald Trump won by less than 45,000 votes last time, and which is close to being a must-win for him this time.Overall these voters tilt blue, with the Indian American Attitudes Survey finding that 72% of them plan to vote for Biden and 22% for Trump. The combination of being brown and very well-educated is predictive of this tilt, with 47% of Indian-American citizens classifying themselves on the liberal spectrum as compared to 23% on the conservative one. From press freedoms to the Black Lives Matter movement, liberal attitudes dominate especially among those born in America.For long the model minority tag of the community also signified that they didn’t adventure beyond professions like engineering, medicine or academics. But over time they have become far likelier to get involved in politics as compared to other Asian groups. Many of them now staff Capitol Hill and this election may also see the Samosa Caucus, collective nickname for Indian-American lawmakers in Congress, grow larger. If Harris does indeed become the first woman vice-president of the US, that would give strong new momentum to the diaspora’s political ambitions up and down the tickets. But the trend is already here.\n",

If skilled workforce and new enterprises are reluctant to locate here on account of abysmal air quality, everyone loses economically.

Consequently, the disruption takes an economic toll, among other things, and drags down the quality of life of urban inhabitants.It’s time to take a closer look at some legislative changes proposed earlier, that tilt the leadership of urban local bodies towards a chief executive model. To ensure this model doesn’t end up without anyone being held accountable for failure, the chief executive should be made directly accountable to his constituents through an election.\n",

            "At core sexual harassment is about refusing to hear no, or even countenance that woman has the choice to assent or not. Witness the common sight of men on motorcycles swerving to yell sexual innuendoes at women. Up and down the country this behaviour is accepted as unavoidable. More systematic stalking draws more censure. But even in such cases, pursuing police action against stalkers is not the norm. Two cases this week highlight why it should be. In Faridabad, Touseef Ahmed shot dead Nikita Tomar whom he met at school. In Mumbai Yogesh Kumar Singh stabbed Malvi Malhotra whom he met at work. She is recovering in hospital. But the takeaway is how quickly this everyday crime can escalate into murder.\n",
            "Changes in law after the Nirbhaya case included notifying stalking as a criminal offence, with repeat offences being non-bailable and punishable by five years imprisonment. But a Kafkaesque justice system, insensitive subcultures of police and the social stigmatisation of victims mean that seeking the law’s protection remains rare. More often the woman will change her routine in various ways, sometimes too traumatised to keep going to school or work. In Nikita’s case a 2018 complaint against Touseef was withdrawn, reportedly under pressure from his politically powerful family. In countless other cases, maleness bestows sufficient impunity in and of itself.\n",
            "Obviously the policing of stalkers must improve. But a host of other institutions from schools to families also need to do a much better job of socialising gender relations. Today, dominant notions of romance reek of male entitlement. While modernity is making men and women engage on technically equal terms on the outside, that transition needs to happen on the mental plane as well. This needs open conversations about what relationships mean, what love means. It’s not coercion. It’s choice.\n",

More systematic stalking draws more censure. But even in such cases, pursuing police action against stalkers is not the norm. Two cases this week highlight why it should be. In Faridabad, Touseef Ahmed shot dead Nikita Tomar whom he met at school. In Mumbai Yogesh Kumar Singh stabbed Malvi Malhotra whom he met at work. She is recovering in hospital. But the takeaway is how quickly this everyday crime can escalate into murder.Changes in law after the Nirbhaya case included notifying stalking as a criminal offence, with repeat offences being non-bailable and punishable by five years imprisonment. But a Kafkaesque justice system, insensitive subcultures of police and the social stigmatisation of victims mean that seeking the law’s protection remains rare. More often the woman will change her routine in various ways, sometimes too traumatised to keep going to school or work. In Nikita’s case a 2018 complaint against Touseef was withdrawn, reportedly under pressure from his politically powerful family. In countless other cases, maleness bestows sufficient impunity in and of itself.Obviously the policing of stalkers must improve. But a host of other institutions from schools to families also need to do a much better job of socialising gender relations. Today, dominant notions of romance reek of male entitlement. While modernity is making men and women engage on technically equal terms on the outside, that transition needs to happen on the mental plane as well. This needs open conversations about what relationships mean, what love means. It’s not coercion. It’s choice.\n",

Opinion polls point to voter fatigue with Nitish even as they predict a comfortable NDA victory. The findings have emboldened Nitish’s detractors within NDA, who have shown ample intent to counter him. LJP fielded candidates against JD(U) while singing Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s praises.\n",
            "Nitish’s flagging popularity combined with LJP’s spoiler act could undermine the prospects of many JD(U) candidates. This raises the possibility of BJP, benefiting greatly from Modi’s general acceptability, powering ahead of JD(U) in seat share, making it a natural claimant for the chief minister’s post. Bihar is the only Hindi heartland state to not have had a BJP CM, and BJP has driven hard bargains with other NDA allies. Thus, constituents within BJP and Sangh Parivar may be hoping that pending their political investment in Nitish, Bihar too is now ripe for a takeover.\n",
            "Yet such a game plan to unseat Nitish without displacing NDA would come fraught with risk. Voters are likely to be confused by LJP’s unconvincing attacks on Nitish while sparing BJP. LJP’s ability to cut into anti-incumbency votes against Nitish is unproven, unless there are subliminal signals to BJP voters in JD(U) constituencies to switch sides. The opposition is no pushover, evident from enthusiastic attendance at RJD rallies disregarding the Covid contagion.

            "Nitish Kumar’s omission from BJP campaign posters ahead of the first phase of polling is further indication of “sushasan babu’s” depleting political capital. Opinion polls point to voter fatigue with Nitish even as they predict a comfortable NDA victory. The findings have emboldened Nitish’s detractors within NDA, who have shown ample intent to counter him. LJP fielded candidates against JD(U) while singing Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s praises.Nitish’s flagging popularity combined with LJP’s spoiler act could undermine the prospects of many JD(U) candidates. This raises the possibility of BJP, benefiting greatly from Modi’s general acceptability, powering ahead of JD(U) in seat share, making it a natural claimant for the chief minister’s post. Bihar is the only Hindi heartland state to not have had a BJP CM, and BJP has driven hard bargains with other NDA allies. Thus, constituents within BJP and Sangh Parivar may be hoping that pending their political investment in Nitish, Bihar too is now ripe for a takeover.Yet such a game plan to unseat Nitish without displacing NDA would come fraught with risk. Voters are likely to be confused by LJP’s unconvincing attacks on Nitish while sparing BJP. LJP’s ability to cut into anti-incumbency votes against Nitish is unproven, unless there are subliminal signals to BJP voters in JD(U) constituencies to switch sides. The opposition is no pushover, evident from enthusiastic attendance at RJD rallies disregarding the Covid contagion. Post-elections, a possible hung assembly scenario could see Nitish doing an Uddhav on BJP and bolting to UPA. NDA’s internal competition and attendant mind games may have put another Bihar election on a knife edge.\n",

            "With reports surfacing that India is looking to start discussions for a trade deal with Taiwan, the Chinese foreign ministry has asked New Delhi to be prudent while dealing with Taipei and reiterated its so-called ‘One China’ principle which sees Taiwan as part of China. This is rich coming from Beijing, which has shown scant regard for the sovereign interests of other countries. Besides, China has no business telling India with whom it can do trade deals. The reality is Taiwan today is a free and independent democracy, and an Asian economic dynamo.\n",
            "Trade between India and Taiwan grew 18% to $7.2 billion in 2019, but there is much headroom for growth. Taiwan is a powerhouse in semiconductors that serve as the backbone of today’s modern economies. Taiwanese companies are well-integrated into global supply chains, bringing high standards of production and logistics to the table. True, Taiwanese companies also do a lot of business in China – which is precisely why it’s hypocritical of Beijing to object to a trade deal between New Delhi and Taipei. But many Taiwanese companies are looking to relocate out of China because of the US-China trade war, disruptions caused by Covid-19, and growing tension between Beijing and Taipei.\n",
            "Add to this Taiwan’s New Southbound Policy that is looking to enhance its connections with 18 countries, including India. Taiwan’s expertise in hardware and India’s in software are a perfect fit. New Delhi shouldn’t be averse to a free trade agreement with Taipei as the latter is higher up the value chain. Taiwanese investments in technology can kick start a tech manufacturing revolution in India. With China breathing down both India’s and Taiwan’s necks, there is additional incentive to create alternative supply chains and cut out Beijing. India-Taiwan ties are a win-win. China’s objections should be ignored.\n",

            "With reports surfacing that India is looking to start discussions for a trade deal with Taiwan, the Chinese foreign ministry has asked New Delhi to be prudent while dealing with Taipei and reiterated its so-called ‘One China’ principle which sees Taiwan as part of China. This is rich coming from Beijing, which has shown scant regard for the sovereign interests of other countries. Besides, China has no business telling India with whom it can do trade deals. The reality is Taiwan today is a free and independent democracy, and an Asian economic dynamo.Trade between India and Taiwan grew 18% to $7.2 billion in 2019, but there is much headroom for growth. Taiwan is a powerhouse in semiconductors that serve as the backbone of today’s modern economies. Taiwanese companies are well-integrated into global supply chains, bringing high standards of production and logistics to the table. True, Taiwanese companies also do a lot of business in China – which is precisely why it’s hypocritical of Beijing to object to a trade deal between New Delhi and Taipei. But many Taiwanese companies are looking to relocate out of China because of the US-China trade war, disruptions caused by Covid-19, and growing tension between Beijing and Taipei.Add to this Taiwan’s New Southbound Policy that is looking to enhance its connections with 18 countries, including India. Taiwan’s expertise in hardware and India’s in software are a perfect fit. New Delhi shouldn’t be averse to a free trade agreement with Taipei as the latter is higher up the value chain. Taiwanese investments in technology can kick start a tech manufacturing revolution in India. With China breathing down both India’s and Taiwan’s necks, there is additional incentive to create alternative supply chains and cut out Beijing. India-Taiwan ties are a win-win. China’s objections should be ignored.\n",
            "519\n",
            "China has asked India to approach Taiwan-related issues prudently amid reports that New Delhi was looking to start trade negotiations with Taipei. This is totally absurd. First, India will decide India’s trade policy in India’s interests. Second, although China insists on the ‘One China’ principle that sees Taiwan as an inalienable part of China, the reality is that Taiwan is independent with a government that exercises full administrative control over the Taiwanese mainland. Therefore, Beijing is in no position to dictate to Taipei.\n",
            "Third, China and Taiwan already have significant commercial relations between themselves, although these ties have been fraying of late because of Beijing’s aggression towards Taipei. In fact, many Taiwanese businesses are looking to relocate out of China, and India provides a good opportunity for them. Besides, when China itself has no qualms about claiming Indian territories like Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh, India doesn’t have to be unduly sensitive about Beijing’s theoretical claims over Taiwan. The latter is free and willing to do business with India. And the potential economic and technological synergies between the two countries are quite attractive.\n",

Further he said that CAA would be implemented very soon: “All of you will get the benefits of the law. We are committed to it.”\n",

What has changed since the pandemic? India’s health and economy have weakened significantly. Its economy contracted 23.9% in the June quarter while Bangladesh is set to overtake its per capita GDP and China is seeing an impressive V-shaped recovery.

            "On a visit to Siliguri to take stock of his party’s organizational matters ahead of the West Bengal elections next year, BJP president JP Nadda said yesterday that the implementation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act had been delayed due to the pandemic, but as that situation is improving rules are now being framed for CAA. Further he said that CAA would be implemented very soon: “All of you will get the benefits of the law. We are committed to it.”The validity of CAA is of course pending before the Supreme Court, where it has been challenged on constitutional grounds, including the ‘basic structure doctrine’. By providing relief to minorities of six other religions living as illegal migrants in India after fleeing religious persecution in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan the law shows an inherent bias against Muslims, when the more humane and non-controversial refugee policy would be to assess persecution on a case by case basis rather than by religion.Before the pandemic the law had opened a gaping trust deficit and seen intense blowback in different parts of the country, and also caused great damage on the foreign policy front, whether specifically in terms of India’s relationship with Bangladesh or generally its image abroad. What has changed since the pandemic? India’s health and economy have weakened significantly. Its economy contracted 23.9% in the June quarter while Bangladesh is set to overtake its per capita GDP and China is seeing an impressive V-shaped recovery. At this point national interest has a clear imperative, to rebuild India’s health and economy. Don’t sacrifice this on a divisive electoral altar.\n",

The fires accounted for 17% of Delhi’s air pollution on Sunday, and further spikes are expected. As air quality declined last week, a familiar political blame game ensued. Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar claimed that farm fires caused only 4% of Delhi’s air pollution and attributed the rest to local factors. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal hit back saying the Centre was “staying in denial”.\n",
            "Instead of passing the buck every year, Centre and state governments could take note of the deeper linkages to air pollution. For instance, waste burning continues in Delhi despite the air quality dip. This points to a solid waste management problem. Blaming the woefully dysfunctional municipal corporations is pointless. Centre and state government must lend their expertise here. Or look at Gurgaon, cast as the “Millennium City” but utterly dependent on diesel gensets because Haryana is yet to master power distribution to its prized urban revenue spinner.\n",
            "Cut to agriculture where Green Revolution solved food shortages but farmers, pampered with power subsidies, pump out groundwater at unsustainable rates in Punjab and Haryana for water guzzling paddy cultivation. In an incredible administrative improvisation, the two governments enacted laws postponing sowing closer to monsoons, but this has pushed the kharif harvest uncomfortably near to rabi sowing. Farmers are now in a mad rush to burn paddy stubble, which itself is a remnant of combine harvesters, hardly an irritant in their native Western monocropped lands unlike India. To rectify these contingencies, happy seeders, rotavators, mulchers and sundry other straw management technologies have been fruitlessly promoted with 80% central subsidy.\n",
            "What is fairly evident is that policy responses spawn fresh problems or detrimental outcomes requiring more bureaucratic or technological solutions, a never ending chain of causation. This year’s big hope is a microbial decomposer which can turn crop residue into manure in 20-25 days, certainly less machine intensive but perhaps more farmer friendly. Cities must fix solid waste management and secure reliable power supply to make waste burning and gensets redundant. To tackle farm fires, market and ecology distorting incentives for paddy, a crop not endemic to Haryana or Punjab, must end, sooner rather than later. Getting basics right remains our most knotty problem.\n",

It can be more liberal in granting visas and even asylum to members of Pakistan’s persecuted civil society. That shouldn’t preclude, of course, fighting terror emanating from Pakistani soil. New Delhi would, in fact, be tackling the same enemy in both cases.

The instances of discord are too numerous to keep listing. Every day brings with it a new storm, often whipped up on social media. Just this February, India’s national capital was witness to large-scale communal rioting, a warning that more violence could ensue if policing is lax. No part of India is safe if the dominant political discourse continues to be about communal issues.Even the Covid pandemic wasn’t immune from hate propaganda against religions. Many brands and companies are worried today about being caught in the communal crossfire, which could hurt private investment in future. With key economic reforms being rolled out one after another, it is important that the country as a whole is enabled to take advantage of the openings that are created.Read: Tanishq store made to apologise for ad\n",

Thackeray has correctly responded by denying any capacity to determine public policy through religious dogma and divine intervention, which no neta should lay claim to. This is the secularism permeating our Constitution, in deference to public interest, reason and scientific temper. The eagerness to pull down India’s secular edifice is a recipe for chaos. During the 1980s India under Rajiv Gandhi and Pakistan under Zia ul Haq allowed religion to dictate state policy, with ruinous consequences down the line.

What’s unusual is that the winners collaborated to build real world applications arising out of their theoretical work.

On the other hand, if a government that wants to auction telecom spectrum has more than one goal, challenges will be plentiful. One of those challenges, in the Indian experience, is to protect potential revenue by preventing collusion among bidders.\n",

Rightly, the retired SC judge found “amazing” a new trend of “attributing something to a speaker he or she never said”.

Policing will turn unaccountable and lax, affecting the quality of governance. How the rape-murder of a Dalit girl in Hathras was handled is only the latest instance of this. Lokur also slammed the “cynics glibly suggesting” that those not guilty will be acquitted – detention is a “gut wrenching experience” and those trusting the judiciary to protect free speech and liberty get overwhelmed by the “painfully slow” justice delivery system. Governments abusing laws is a precursor to lawlessness in society. Dissent may be an irritant to some, but it’s also our best antidote to governance failures.\n",

The rebellion is being led by ex-Congressman Sudip Roy Barman who claims to have seven more MLAs with him, while there is suspicion that a few more legislators including a couple of ministers are sympathetic to his demands. However, BJP can be relieved that neither the dissidents nor ally IPFT has shown inclination to bring down the government.\n",

Barman had fancied himself a chief ministerial candidate after BJP’s stunning victory in 2018 and was upset at Deb, a staunch partyman with an RSS and ABVP background, being chosen.

            "The dissidence in the Tripura BJP legislative contingent that is posing an open challenge to chief minister Biplab Deb puts a question mark on the party’s strategy of wooing Congress leaders to its fold. The rebellion is being led by ex-Congressman Sudip Roy Barman who claims to have seven more MLAs with him, while there is suspicion that a few more legislators including a couple of ministers are sympathetic to his demands. However, BJP can be relieved that neither the dissidents nor ally IPFT has shown inclination to bring down the government.The rebels have dubbed Deb an autocrat, holding too many departments with himself. Barman had fancied himself a chief ministerial candidate after BJP’s stunning victory in 2018 and was upset at Deb, a staunch partyman with an RSS and ABVP background, being chosen. The strategy of drawing defectors from Congress and other regional parties has been credited for BJP’s nationwide spread to the country’s east and northeast.

            "Putting out a prudent message, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan has called for extra vigil during the upcoming festival season in light of the Covid pandemic. Although active Covid cases have continued to slide for the tenth consecutive day – India on Sunday recorded less than 70,000 cases and lower than 900 fatalities for the first time in the previous six days – Vardhan is absolutely right in cautioning against ostentatious celebrations. Recent festivals across states – such as Ganesh Chaturthi in Maharashtra and Onam in Kerala – have seen a considerable Covid spike. And with Durga Puja, Navratri and Diwali around the corner, the festivals could turn super-spreaders.\n",
            "That would be disastrous just ahead of winter’s cold weather expected to cause a big surge in Covid cases. An expert committee on Covid has warned Delhi could see as many as 15,000 daily cases this winter. The festival season and winter months could prove a double whammy for Covid containment efforts. The next three months are extremely crucial and will determine if the country can stave off the worst of the pandemic.\n",
            "In this regard, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority has temporarily lifted restrictions on religious gatherings for the coming festive season with strict guidelines on crowd control, masking, thermal screening and perimeter restrictions. Authorities must enforce masking, impose strict penalties, immediately withdraw permission if violations are found. In Kolkata, the pre-Durga Puja shopping spree has already seen a spike in daily Covid cases – on October 8 the city registered 765 new cases compared to 380 on September 8. With more than 37,000 public pujas being organised across Bengal this year, lack of extreme caution will be catastrophic.\n",
            "Understandably, many have pandemic fatigue and see the festival season as an opportunity to break out of the doom and gloom. But if large scale festivals lead to large scale Covid cases and deaths, they are simply not worth it. Besides, there is light at the end of the tunnel with several Covid vaccines already in the final stages of clinical trial. It’s very likely some will be available early next year. Therefore, it makes sense to have low-key, smaller festivals this year so that we can redouble celebrations once most people are vaccinated. Let’s be smart, follow guidelines and have safe festivals this time around. The ultimate assessment of governments’ overall pandemic record too will lie in whether they can stave off a festival surge now.\n",

            "Just before the next round of talks between Indian and Chinese military commanders to resolve the standoff in eastern Ladakh, US national security adviser Robert O’Brien has said that time has come to accept that dialogue will not persuade Beijing to change its ways. O’Brien has a strong point. Beijing’s belligerence and extravagant territorial claims have only been growing in recent years.\n",
            "That said, counterbalancing an aggressive China through platforms like Quad and keeping channels of communication open with Beijing should not be seen as mutually exclusive. Doing so raises the probability of misjudgement and conflict, which is in nobody’s interest. In this regard, China has in recent weeks hinted at reviving the 1959 LAC with India. As per this proposal, China will pretty much retain Aksai Chin in the Ladakh region while giving up its claims on Arunachal Pradesh.\n",
            "Retaining what each side has and making it the basis for settling the international border is the best solution to the India-China confrontation. After all, New Delhi has no hope of wresting Aksai Chin from Beijing just as Chinese claims on Arunachal are a pipe dream. But the deal needs to be sold to domestic constituencies. Just as it’s said that only a Republican president such as Richard Nixon could have made a rapprochement with Mao’s China, Prime Minister Narendra Modi alone has the capacity to sell an LAC deal in India, as no one will question his nationalist credentials. With Modi and Xi slated to come face-to-face at the virtual Brics summit next month, New Delhi should explore if Beijing is serious about the 1959 LAC proposal. If it is, then Modi could actualise a historic deal. Else, with the situation deadlocked on the LAC we are heading towards its LoC-isation, which will inflict a heavy military and economic burden on India.\n",

            "Just before the next round of talks between Indian and Chinese military commanders to resolve the standoff in eastern Ladakh, US national security adviser Robert O’Brien has said that time has come to accept that dialogue will not persuade Beijing to change its ways. O’Brien has a strong point. Beijing’s belligerence and extravagant territorial claims have only been growing in recent years.That said, counterbalancing an aggressive China through platforms like Quad and keeping channels of communication open with Beijing should not be seen as mutually exclusive. Doing so raises the probability of misjudgement and conflict, which is in nobody’s interest. In this regard, China has in recent weeks hinted at reviving the 1959 LAC with India. As per this proposal, China will pretty much retain Aksai Chin in the Ladakh region while giving up its claims on Arunachal Pradesh.Retaining what each side has and making it the basis for settling the international border is the best solution to the India-China confrontation. After all, New Delhi has no hope of wresting Aksai Chin from Beijing just as Chinese claims on Arunachal are a pipe dream. But the deal needs to be sold to domestic constituencies. Just as it’s said that only a Republican president such as Richard Nixon could have made a rapprochement with Mao’s China, Prime Minister Narendra Modi alone has the capacity to sell an LAC deal in India, as no one will question his nationalist credentials. With Modi and Xi slated to come face-to-face at the virtual Brics summit next month, New Delhi should explore if Beijing is serious about the 1959 LAC proposal. If it is, then Modi could actualise a historic deal. Else, with the situation deadlocked on the LAC we are heading towards its LoC-isation, which will inflict a heavy military and economic burden on India.\n",

This was not an inconsiderable takeaway of the exchange between  Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Kamala Harris, which was marked by the civility that was so appallingly missing from last week’s presidential debate.  With less than a month remaining before the US elections, of course Pence and Harris sparred hard on everything from the pandemic and healthcare to racial justice, going frontal on some questions while dodging others. But what they were voicing were serious policy differences between the Republican and Democratic parties rather than personal dislike or disrespect.\n",

They are arguably acting on the margins of the contest. But for their respective parties, especially at the grassroots, the two vice-presidential candidates did a good job of laying out the party lines. With the speakers separated by a plexiglass barrier, Harris cast the White House’s handling of the pandemic as “the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country.” Said White House has now emerged as a Covid hotspot, and still its messaging on masks and other safety measures remains unreformed. After the debate, Pence’s spouse took the stage without a mask while Harris’s did it with a mask.\n",

            "When participants adhere to the rules of the game, debates can indeed deliver their stated goal of putting forward opposing arguments coherently. This was not an inconsiderable takeaway of the exchange between  Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Kamala Harris, which was marked by the civility that was so appallingly missing from last week’s presidential debate.  With less than a month remaining before the US elections, of course Pence and Harris sparred hard on everything from the pandemic and healthcare to racial justice, going frontal on some questions while dodging others. But what they were voicing were serious policy differences between the Republican and Democratic parties rather than personal dislike or disrespect.Read also: VP Debate Takeaways: Pandemic looms over a more civil fightWith a new opinion poll showing President Donald Trump trailing Vice President Joe Biden by a weighty 16 points, plus the pandemic and the President dominating the news cycle, it is not likely that the Pence-Harris debate will move the needle much. They are arguably acting on the margins of the contest. But for their respective parties, especially at the grassroots, the two vice-presidential candidates did a good job of laying out the party lines. With the speakers separated by a plexiglass barrier, Harris cast the White House’s handling of the pandemic as “the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country.” Said White House has now emerged as a Covid hotspot, and still its messaging on masks and other safety measures remains unreformed. After the debate, Pence’s spouse took the stage without a mask while Harris’s did it with a mask.\n",

While US secretary of state Mike Pompeo called out China’s bullying tactics in the South and East China Seas, the Mekong, the Taiwan Strait, and in the Himalayas – a clear reference to the ongoing India-China border standoff – the other foreign ministers insisted on upholding international rules, respecting territorial integrity and maintaining freedom of navigation and overflight in the region.\n",

It is welcome that all the Quad members now have agreements among themselves that allow their militaries to access each other’s bases and coordinate closely. Stepping up such arrangements can be a low cost way of balancing Beijing, if the latter insists on building bases for its navy through the region. This arrangement needs to be expanded to other East Asian nations to create a platform that can resist China’s bullying, especially on the high seas.\n",

            "Andhra Pradesh chief minister Jagan Mohan Reddy’s meetings in quick succession with Narendra Modi and Amit Shah could indicate an imminent NDA expansion. For BJP, still reeling from Akali Dal’s sudden exit, Jagan’s entry would send a strong political signal. Flight of partners like Akali Dal and Shiv Sena hinted at the NDA platform junking its consultative approach, thereby losing favour with regional parties. While neutral parties support Centre’s legislative agenda in Parliament, they leave the heavy lifting outside to BJP. This is where influential outfits like YSCRP as official partners could ease governance tangles.\n",
            "Andhra Pradesh, along with Punjab and Haryana, leads in paddy procurement by government. So Jagan’s backing for farm reforms and presence in NDA can help BJP fight misconceptions aroused by the Akali exit. But Jagan, like Chandrababu Naidu earlier, is in no position to dictate terms to BJP owing to its Lok Sabha majority. The state’s bifurcation in 2014 has left Andhra chronically in revenue deficit. But NDA membership may not be enough to convince the Centre on special category status, as Naidu learned to his dismay.\n",
            "Perceptions also abound that Jagan is more hamstrung than Naidu was. The spectre of CBI cases that haunted him during UPA-2 is oft cited. A spate of temple desecrations has put Jagan, a practising Christian, on the backfoot as TDP and Hindu rightwing attacks over failing law and order mount. Dwindling revenue receipts strain his elaborate package of welfare schemes that swayed voters in 2019.

            "Andhra Pradesh chief minister Jagan Mohan Reddy’s meetings in quick succession with Narendra Modi and Amit Shah could indicate an imminent NDA expansion. For BJP, still reeling from Akali Dal’s sudden exit, Jagan’s entry would send a strong political signal. Flight of partners like Akali Dal and Shiv Sena hinted at the NDA platform junking its consultative approach, thereby losing favour with regional parties. While neutral parties support Centre’s legislative agenda in Parliament, they leave the heavy lifting outside to BJP. This is where influential outfits like YSCRP as official partners could ease governance tangles.Andhra Pradesh, along with Punjab and Haryana, leads in paddy procurement by government. So Jagan’s backing for farm reforms and presence in NDA can help BJP fight misconceptions aroused by the Akali exit. But Jagan, like Chandrababu Naidu earlier, is in no position to dictate terms to BJP owing to its Lok Sabha majority. The state’s bifurcation in 2014 has left Andhra chronically in revenue deficit. But NDA membership may not be enough to convince the Centre on special category status, as Naidu learned to his dismay.Perceptions also abound that Jagan is more hamstrung than Naidu was. The spectre of CBI cases that haunted him during UPA-2 is oft cited. A spate of temple desecrations has put Jagan, a practising Christian, on the backfoot as TDP and Hindu rightwing attacks over failing law and order mount. Dwindling revenue receipts strain his elaborate package of welfare schemes that swayed voters in 2019. Some day, YSRCP and BJP will cross swords with the latter aspiring to replace TDP as the state’s primary opposition. Last year, four TDP Rajya Sabha MPs and many local leaders defected to BJP. But BJP is no immediate threat and Jagan has made too many promises to voters. A partnership may just suit both sides in their hour of need.\n",

To make matters tricky for Nitish, LJP isn’t leaving the NDA. JD(U) has reason to protest, but BJP may not oblige it. The latter has, after all, let Chirag train his guns on Nitish for several months. Even if Nitish secures LJP’s ouster from NDA, Chirag’s gameplan is clear.

Moreover, BJP will argue it has no reason to antagonise Chirag who readily accepts Narendra Modi’s leadership.\n",

If BJP wins more seats than JD(U) it will have a legitimate claim for the CM post. But Nitish is a seasoned politician with an incredible track record of flitting effortlessly between political divides. In 2017 he returned to the NDA fold just as easily as he embraced UPA in 2015. BJP’s challenge is to prevent a replay of Maharashtra last year, when Shiv Sena joined hands with UPA to bag the CM post.\n",
            "In Bihar politics, all permutations are possible except a BJP-Congress and perhaps RJD-BJP tie-up. So current pre-poll alliances may or may not last beyond the elections. Nitish must worry about LJP because it was a similar gambit by Ram Vilas Paswan in 2005, contesting against RJD in 178 seats though both were national partners in UPA, that ended Lalu Prasad’s 15-year-long sway over Bihar. LJP won 29 seats and cornered a 12.3% vote share. If history were to repeat, this would be Nitish’s turn to be tripped by another Paswan after another 15 year hegemony.\n",
            "A recent opinion poll points to Nitish’s unpopularity while predicting a conclusive NDA victory. This is bad news for JD(U). In a closely fought race the votes polled by LJP, however marginal, could give BJP or even RJD the edge in pushing their CM of choice. Chirag has garnered the spotlight by openly challenging Nitish. But Nitish’s success in growing his party beyond a narrow caste base is worth studying for Bihar’s younger politicians even as they hammer away at his failures.\n",

Not only is police important to ensure justice, it has also become the fallback option for governments dealing with almost any kind of emergency. But several recent cases, such as the alleged gang-rape and death of a Dalit teenager from UP’s Hathras district, actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death in Mumbai, and the custodial deaths of a father and son in Tamil Nadu’s Sathankulam town, have turned the spotlight on grave lapses in police functioning.\n",

For example, with the AIIMS panel finding that Rajput’s is categorically a case of hanging and death by suicide, the Narcotics Control Bureau’s high-intensity pursuit of Rhea Chakraborty and others is under serious cloud. So is CBI’s investigation of abetment, where causative factors of suicide are usually deeply individual, complex and multifaceted.\n",

After all, there are structural flaws in the police that lead to two mutually reinforcing trends: Criminalisation of politics and politicisation of crime (note how the SSR case has found resonance in the Bihar election campaign). Unless these flaws are addressed, India’s constitutional vision will not materialise for many people.\n",
            "It is also true that India’s police force is ill equipped and made to work in almost inhuman conditions. The Status of Policing in India Report (2019) pointed out that at the national level only 75.2% of the sanctioned personnel strength has been filled, in UP a mere 46.9%. Filling these resource gaps is important but so is operational autonomy for police. For over a decade SC has tried to loosen the grip of the political executive over the police force but governments, of all political persuasions, have been resistant. A modicum of fairness in appointments and transfers is a prerequisite for mending India’s criminal justice system.\n",

After all, there are structural flaws in the police that lead to two mutually reinforcing trends: Criminalisation of politics and politicisation of crime (note how the SSR case has found resonance in the Bihar election campaign). Unless these flaws are addressed, India’s constitutional vision will not materialise for many people.It is also true that India’s police force is ill equipped and made to work in almost inhuman conditions. The Status of Policing in India Report (2019) pointed out that at the national level only 75.2% of the sanctioned personnel strength has been filled, in UP a mere 46.9%. Filling these resource gaps is important but so is operational autonomy for police. For over a decade SC has tried to loosen the grip of the political executive over the police force but governments, of all political persuasions, have been resistant. A modicum of fairness in appointments and transfers is a prerequisite for mending India’s criminal justice system. \n",

Therefore, any dent that opposition parties make in BJP’s UP base will be to their benefit.\n",

There are no signs yet that the Chinese are willing to disengage from the intruded sites at Pangong Tso and Depsang Plains. Nevertheless, Beijing’s invocation of the 1959 LAC, as referenced by former Chinese premier Zhou Enlai to former prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru that year, is an interesting one that’s worth following up on.\n",
            "The 1959 LAC could be a reasonable starting point for the border demarcation process. In its original iteration it was proposed that the armed forces of India and China each withdraw 20km from the McMahon Line in the east, and from the line up to which each side exercises actual control in the west. This would settle the border as it actually exists on the ground with minor adjustments.\n",
            "India has rejected this position saying it never accepted the unilaterally declared 1959 LAC by China. This is of course diplomatically correct. New Delhi doesn’t know whether Beijing’s new enthusiasm for the 1959 LAC is genuine or just another ruse to consolidate territorial gains it has made this time around, with more salami slicing tactics to come in the future. However, in the event that Beijing is interested in settling the border overall, broadly on the basis of current holdings, then it’s an opportunity New Delhi must seize. It’s worth sending out some feelers through backdoor channels, to guage Beijing’s sincerity. China has opened too many international fronts simultaneously, and may be feeling the heat. The possibility that it may be willing to settle matters with New Delhi shouldn’t be left unexplored.\n",

            "India and China held the fifth round of diplomatic talks on the LAC standoff and again agreed on the need to implement a consensus to disengage from the friction points in eastern Ladakh. There are no signs yet that the Chinese are willing to disengage from the intruded sites at Pangong Tso and Depsang Plains. Nevertheless, Beijing’s invocation of the 1959 LAC, as referenced by former Chinese premier Zhou Enlai to former prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru that year, is an interesting one that’s worth following up on.The 1959 LAC could be a reasonable starting point for the border demarcation process. In its original iteration it was proposed that the armed forces of India and China each withdraw 20km from the McMahon Line in the east, and from the line up to which each side exercises actual control in the west. This would settle the border as it actually exists on the ground with minor adjustments.India has rejected this position saying it never accepted the unilaterally declared 1959 LAC by China. This is of course diplomatically correct. New Delhi doesn’t know whether Beijing’s new enthusiasm for the 1959 LAC is genuine or just another ruse to consolidate territorial gains it has made this time around, with more salami slicing tactics to come in the future. However, in the event that Beijing is interested in settling the border overall, broadly on the basis of current holdings, then it’s an opportunity New Delhi must seize.

As per the verdict, the court found that the demolition of the masjid was not pre-planned, the authenticity of the audio and video recordings provided by the CBI could not be proved, and that in the final analysis anti-social elements demolished the structure and the accused even tried to stop them.With this veteran BJP leaders like LK Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi and Uma Bharti stand acquitted. But the verdict also raises some pertinent questions. The demolition of the Babri Masjid was a dark day for Indian democracy. It took place in front of news cameras. The Supreme Court had acknowledged it as a crime that shook the secular fabric of India. It now appears that Indian democracy, law enforcement agencies and the judicial system are powerless to enforce rule of law in the face of brute majoritarianism. If the demolition of the masjid and accompanying riots are seen simply as the outpouring of mass emotion, what is the guarantee that such outpourings won’t recur and direct its ire at other minority targets? Is mob rule and anarchic violence then to be India’s future destiny? It is precisely because the Indian legal system has time and again failed to comprehensively prosecute mob violence that riots keep recurring under a culture of impunity. However, such violence can be easily suppressed or nipped in the bud through timely police intervention and strict prosecution of troublemakers. It is precisely because the system is constantly looking over its shoulder for fear of upsetting political masters that matters escalate and go beyond control. The Babri verdict once again forces the Indian police-judicial system to take a hard look at itself.Live: All Indians expect Centre, state to challenge Babri verdict, says CongAll acquitted in Babri case: Key points of verdict\n",

A tax policy that is predictable and easy to follow is the best possible way to encourage investments. This means that the government should publicly and unequivocally state that it will never resort to retrospective amendments from now on. The 2012 amendment undermined India’s claim to be a jurisdiction underpinned by the rule of law. Reputations matter in attracting investments. A decade’s experience – when the animal spirits unleashed by India’s post-1991 liberalisation were caged again – should teach us that. Move on, turn the page.\n",

UN chief Antonio Guterres has called out the “horrifying global surge” of violence against women and girls in their own homes. Some countries have reported a 30% rise in domestic violence cases, distress calls are doubling and tripling, internet searches on how to escape abusive homes have spiked. The UN chief called for governments everywhere to address this emergency as part of their pandemic strategy.\n",
            "Domestic violence is a pervasive crime, cutting across place, class, age, religion or race. It has been described as patriarchal terrorism — the victim lives in constant fear, as the perpetrator needs to exercise power and control. Domestic abuse persists through generations; children who grow up in homes where their mother is cowering and terrified, are marked by that experience. The home, a place of refuge, is a place where they feel hunted and unsafe. Women often depend on their partners for food and shelter, they fear being cut off from their homes and children, and lack access to jobs.\n",
            "We need a renewed determination to combat this crime. Some countries have evolved new ways for women to signal distress, some have enlisted delivery and postal workers to report abuse. Many have expanded health shelters to take in victims of violence. India cannot afford to ignore this shadow epidemic either.\n",

            "The whole world is visibly afflicted by the Covid-19 pandemic. But behind closed doors, another dark drama is playing out. UN chief Antonio Guterres has called out the “horrifying global surge” of violence against women and girls in their own homes. Some countries have reported a 30% rise in domestic violence cases, distress calls are doubling and tripling, internet searches on how to escape abusive homes have spiked. The UN chief called for governments everywhere to address this emergency as part of their pandemic strategy.Domestic violence is a pervasive crime, cutting across place, class, age, religion or race. It has been described as patriarchal terrorism — the victim lives in constant fear, as the perpetrator needs to exercise power and control. Domestic abuse persists through generations; children who grow up in homes where their mother is cowering and terrified, are marked by that experience. The home, a place of refuge, is a place where they feel hunted and unsafe. Women often depend on their partners for food and shelter, they fear being cut off from their homes and children, and lack access to jobs.We need a renewed determination to combat this crime. Some countries have evolved new ways for women to signal distress, some have enlisted delivery and postal workers to report abuse. Many have expanded health shelters to take in victims of violence. India cannot afford to ignore this shadow epidemic either.\n",

But the CAG report tabled in Parliament says that the two firms have hitherto failed to deliver on their promise to discharge 30% of their offset obligations by offering high technology to DRDO.

But this popularity doesn’t replicate at the national level because the game hasn’t been promoted much. That said, I have hope for the future as in the past few years, basketball has started gaining prominence in people’s minds – one can find basketball videos being shared on social media and other online platforms.

Also, participation in such leagues creates a hunger in the belly and players are motivated to perform well and prove their worth.

            "Prime Minister Narendra Modi has exhorted state governments to lift localised lockdowns and short weekend lockdowns to boost economic sentiment. Chhattisgarh this week imposed lockdowns in 13 districts to combat a spurt in cases. Rajasthan has imposed Section 144 CrPC in a number of cities, which has the same effect as a lockdown. Earlier, various states like Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Assam, Tamil Nadu, Bihar and Bengal had experimented with limited lockdowns. One of the reasons cited for weekend lockdowns is that it helps in keeping up the state of high alert among citizens.\n",
            "However, these have been lifted in many places but most states still have various curbs on movement, especially inter-state transport, and restrictions on opening of shops beyond certain hours. These curbs continue to remain a dampener for businesses. The spurt of cases that began toward the end of the nationwide lockdown in late-May was reason enough to not proceed down the same path. Yet states reposed faith in lockdowns despite Centre junking this strategy.\n",
            "The next central guidelines for unlocking must unequivocally remove all restrictions that hinder movement and trade. Night curfews for example are still followed despite no evident benefits. Inter state movement is difficult because of diverse and confusing quarantine rules. Citizens must be persuaded to wear masks, follow social distancing and get themselves tested as soon as symptoms appear or a primary contact is detected positive. All safety measures beyond this are turning out to be economically restrictive. The 24% decline in GDP is a calamity that will take more lives and livelihoods than the pandemic, which can be managed with public health interventions.\n",

            "Prime Minister Narendra Modi has exhorted state governments to lift localised lockdowns and short weekend lockdowns to boost economic sentiment. Chhattisgarh this week imposed lockdowns in 13 districts to combat a spurt in cases. Rajasthan has imposed Section 144 CrPC in a number of cities, which has the same effect as a lockdown. Earlier, various states like Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Assam, Tamil Nadu, Bihar and Bengal had experimented with limited lockdowns. One of the reasons cited for weekend lockdowns is that it helps in keeping up the state of high alert among citizens.However, these have been lifted in many places but most states still have various curbs on movement, especially inter-state transport, and restrictions on opening of shops beyond certain hours. These curbs continue to remain a dampener for businesses. The spurt of cases that began toward the end of the nationwide lockdown in late-May was reason enough to not proceed down the same path. Yet states reposed faith in lockdowns despite Centre junking this strategy.The next central guidelines for unlocking must unequivocally remove all restrictions that hinder movement and trade. Night curfews for example are still followed despite no evident benefits. Inter state movement is difficult because of diverse and confusing quarantine rules. Citizens must be persuaded to wear masks, follow social distancing and get themselves tested as soon as symptoms appear or a primary contact is detected positive. All safety measures beyond this are turning out to be economically restrictive. The 24% decline in GDP is a calamity that will take more lives and livelihoods than the pandemic, which can be managed with public health interventions.\n",

            "The Lok Sabha on Monday passed a bill to amend the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act. It is an overarching legislation to regulate the inflow of foreign money, a sensitive issue in India. Since its introduction in 1976, subsequent iterations of FCRA have become more stringent, even as India has opened up to foreign contributions in many areas. The latest iteration carries forward the restrictive tradition. It is not only more stringent, it also prescribes administrative caps for recipients and in general enhances the power of the bureaucracy.\n",
            "The bill’s stated aim is to strengthen the compliance mechanism of the law, enhance transparency and help genuine NGOs. These are unexceptionable goals. The question is whether the amendment to the law serves the goals. This is unlikely. According to the government, annual inflow of foreign contributions almost doubled between 2010 and 2019. However, some of these were not used for the stated purpose or failed to meet compliance requirements. Moreover, 19,000 registrations of recipient organisations were cancelled between 2011 and 2019. All of this suggests that successive governments have kept a tight watch on FCRA contributions. Presumably, the earlier iteration of the law was adequate to weed out the rotten apples.\n",

Many NGOs with an established track record have been at the forefront of relief measures. In this context, it’s hard to understand the logic of making the process of receipt of contributions more difficult. The government is open to including thinktanks in the preparatory process of important legislative bills. Some of them receive support through FCRA. Yet, it doesn’t trust them enough to use the money appropriately. So, we now have the government capping administrative expenses at 20%, regardless of the nature of the work.\n",

Two key demands – examination of bills by a select committee and deferment of headcount – didn’t find favour with the government and the House chair. Checks and balances enshrined in parliamentary processes must be given their due respect.

Far from impressing ordinary citizens, the political divisiveness is deeply distressing for them.

There were \\nserious doubts in the minds of many about India's ability to ful\\x00ll the dreams and aspirations of her citizens.\\n\\nBut, if challenges were enormous, so was our resolve to build a stronger, safer and prosperous nation. \\nPowered  and  inspired  by  the  strengths  and  skills  of  130  crore  Indians,  we  conve\\x00ed  obstacles  into \\noppo\\x00unities, decay into development and pessimism into positivity. \\n\\nAt an unimaginable speed and scale, what seemed impossible earlier soon became a reality. In the last \\x00ve \\n\\x00ve years, every Indian family got a bank account due to Jan Dhan Yojana, 50 crore Indians got health \\ninsurance thanks to Ayushman Bharat and more than 40 crore people in the unorganised sector  can now \\navail pension coverage. A subject like cleanliness ignited the imagination of the nation and now we are close \\nto 99% sanitation coverage, compared to a mere 38% in 2014. It is now possible for youngsters from smaller \\ntowns to become entrepreneurs thanks to Mudra Yojana. The rising neo-middle and middle class with \\ntaxable income upto Rs. 5 lakhs no longer need  to pay income tax.\\n\\nOur Government \\x00lled the infrastructure gaps with speed and foresight. The pace of construction of roads \\nand railway lines has doubled. India has now more e\\x00cient po\\x00s. 18,000 villages living in darkness till 2014 \\nare now brightly lit thanks to rural electri\\x00cation e\\x00o\\x00s. More than 2.6 crore homes have been electri\\x00ed \\nthrough Saubhagya Yojana. Over 1.5 crore homes built over the last \\x00ve years have enabled millions to \\ndream big.\\n\\nThe nation is no longer helpless against the barbaric forces of terror. Any destructive ideology that destroys \\nthe atmosphere of peace and unity is and will be given a be\\x00\\x00ing reply. They are being paid back in their own \\ncoin, with compound interest. \\n\\nIndia's  No\\x00heast,  which  earlier  made  headlines  for  blockage  and  neglect,  is  now  witnessing \\nunprecedented development. The No\\x00heast is now closer to the national mainstream in more ways than \\none. \\n\\n3\\n\\n\\x0cThe Central Government has waged a determined crusade against the scourge of corruption and black \\nmoney. The culture of middlemen roaming in the corridors of power is now history. Decisions are guided by \\npublic interest of all Indians and not the self-interest of a select few. The trinity of Jan Dhan- Aadhaar and \\nMobile has weeded out over 8 crore fake bene\\x00ciaries, and prevented leakages of more than Rs. 1   lakh \\ncrore. Systems have been strengthened to prevent money laundering. The corrupt have begun to realize \\nthat their machinations will no longer be tolerated.\\n\\nOne can clearly see how development has become a mass movement. Numerous people friendly decisions \\nhave led to the empowerment of 130 crore Indians and the safeguarding of our strategic interests. \\n\\nToday, India stands tall at the international level. The world recognizes India's immense potential, which is \\nclearly re\\x00ected in a record rise in foreign investment. India's stand on subjects like terrorism, climate \\nchange and prevention of money laundering are se\\x00ing the global narrative.\\n\\nFriends,\\n \\nThrough this Sankalp Patra, you would get a glimpse of the challenges of the yesteryears, the indomitable \\ne\\x00o\\x00s made by 130 crore Indians to overcome those challenges and our collective vision for the future. \\n\\nWe have achieved a lot in the last \\x00ve years and we want to do lot more. There are two commitments that I \\nam extremely passionate about- doubling of farmer income and housing for all, by the year 2022. With your \\nsuppo\\x00, I am sure both will happen.\\n\\nI thank lakhs of ale\\x00, commi\\x00ed and patriotic citizens of India, who have enriched the Sankalp Patra with \\ntheir valuable inputs. This  Sankalp Patra is the voice of the people in the truest sense.\\n\\nYour vote in 2014 for a strong and decisive government enabled us to \\x00ll some of the biggest sho\\x00comings \\nof \\x00ve decades of dynastic rule in a sho\\x00 span of just \\x00ve years. Now that these sho\\x00comings have been \\nsuccessfully addressed, imagine the pace at which we can work in the times to come.\\n\\nThe  next  \\x00ve  years  are  crucial  because  in  2022,  we  mark  the  75th  anniversary  of  our  Independence. \\nGenerations of great women and men laid down their lives so that we could  breathe the air of freedom. It is \\nour sacred duty to create the India of their dreams. \\n\\nIn 2047, our nation would complete a hundred years of freedom. Let us together imagine what is the kind of \\nIndia that we want by 2047. The BJP pledges to make the next \\x00ve years as the foundation laying period for \\nIndia of 2047. Let us together lay the foundations of this vision now, and work earnestly towards translating \\nthis vision into a golden reality. \\n\\nHaving seen the work of di\\x00erent political pa\\x00ies and ideologies, the people of India are convinced that if \\nthere is one pa\\x00y that can address  their problems, it is the BJP. The Mantra of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas' has \\nresonated across the length and breadth of India. BJP is a pa\\x00y for every Indian. It is a Pa\\x00y that works 24/7 \\nat the grassroots level. That is why, the suppo\\x00 we have received has been  historic and unprecedented\\nNew India has broken from the shackles of the past. Today, we are a nation that is daring to dream and \\ndreaming to dare. There is an air of hope and a spirit of aspiration among the youth. \\n\\nTogether, let us work towards building a strong and inclusive India, whose citizens are assured of dignity, \\nprosperity, security and oppo\\x00unity. \\n\\nVande Mataram! \\n\\nNarendra Modi\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\x0cPresident\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\n\\nNote\\n\\nBharatiya Janata Pa\\x00y is commi\\x00ed to Indian values, to making Antyodaya (Garib Kalyan) a reality and to \\nre-establishing the ideals of nation building. Our promises originate from our \\x00ve commitments (Panch-\\nNishtha). We have an ideology that inspires us to ful\\x00l our promises, which are not just limited to elections \\nand election manifestos. Inclusive development, good governance, national security, promotion of our \\ncultural heritage at a global level and continuance of a multi-dimensional progress are the salient features \\nof our ideology that continues to be a pa\\x00 of our promises and commitments to the nation. None of the \\nvision documents or manifestos of the Bharatiya Janata Pa\\x00y are either temporary or a mere pile of papers. \\nEvery single word wri\\x00en in our manifesto signi\\x00es our commitment to the nation and its people.\\n\\nBharatiya Janata Pa\\x00y has been active in public sphere for decades guided by the ideological foundation \\nlaid down by Dr Syama Prasad Mookerjee and carried forward by Pt. Deendayal Upadhyaya through his \\nmission of Antyodaya (Garib Kalyan) . Whenever our pa\\x00y has received the mandate of the Indian people to \\ngovern the country, we have served the people and ful\\x00lled their wishes with full sincerity and commitment. \\nUnder Atalji\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leadership, when the BJP-led NDA government won the mandate to govern the country, our \\npa\\x00y ensured that the bene\\x00ts of development and good governance reach the last citizen at the bo\\x00om \\nof the societal ladder. Antyodaya (Garib Kalyan) remains Bharatiya Janata Pa\\x00y\\xe2\\x80\\x99s path, its resolve and goal. \\n\\nToday, when we are ushering in the biggest festival of democracy - the General Elections of 2019, I would \\nlike to dwell on the resolves made by the BJP. In 2014, when the BJP presented its Vision Document before \\nthe people, India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s march of development had already been derailed because of the UPA government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\ninaction and policy paralysis. It was a phase when the hope of seeing a corruption free and transparent \\ngovernment  realised  seemed  impossible.  Nobody  was  ready  to  believe  that  multi-dimensional \\ndevelopmental goals could be achieved without reso\\x00ing to corruption. However, the government led by \\nPrime Minister Shri Narendra Modi turned this belief into a reality by successfully running the government in \\na  transparent  manner.  We  have  succeeded  in  conveying  this  message  to  the  people  at  large  that \\ngovernance is possible without corruption.\\n\\nIn 2014, Shri Narendra Modi emerged as the symbol of the aspirations of the people of India and we made \\nsome promises. Today, when we are at this juncture of elections and facing the electorate, I can asse\\x00 with \\nimmense pride and satisfaction that the journey of resolves and commitments that began in 2014 will \\ncontinue to be carried forward in accordance with the wishes of the people. We have succeeded in kindling \\nfaith towards development in the minds of people and have convinced them that the Narendra Modi led \\nBJP government is the harbinger of a New India.   The same people who used to once say, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothing can \\nhappen  in  this  country\\xe2\\x80\\x9d,  are  now  hopeful  and  say,  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe  can  do  more\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  while  standing  united  for  the \\ndevelopment of India. \\n\\nIt has been seen in the past that even if a government continues to govern the country for a period of twenty \\nyears, it succeeds in taking one or two historic decisions. In its tenure of \\x00ve years, the government led by \\nPrime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has been able to take many decisions which are historic and has ushered \\nin a comprehensive and fundamental transformation. Swachh Bharat Mission, Ujjawala Yojana, Saubhagya \\nYojana, Demonetisation, GST, Surgical Strikes, Air Strikes, total electri\\x00cation, provision for housing for 2.5 \\ncrore families, health insurance under Ayushman Bharat for more than 50 crore people and disbursement \\n\\n5\\n\\n\\x0cof loans to more than 14 crore people under MUDRA Yojana are some of the historic achievements of our \\ngovernment. The Congress led UPA government could never have dreamt of achieving, let alone envisaging \\nsuch watershed policy initiatives. The idea of ful\\x00lling the basic necessities of every ordinary citizen is \\nintrinsic to our pa\\x00y\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ideology. \\n\\nIn  last  \\x00ve  years  our  government  has  done  incredible  work  in  establishing  a  transparent  system  of \\ngovernance,  fu\\x00hering  economic  development  and  increasing  people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  pa\\x00icipation  in  the  country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\nprogress. Today, India is the sixth largest economy in the world and from the point of view of ease of doing \\nbusiness we have emerged as one of the best destinations in the world. India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prestige on the global stage \\nis at an all-time high since Independence. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, we \\nhave been able to make an India that our friends praise, our competitors respect and our enemies fear. India \\nis now in a position to adopt an independent stand on national security, to successfully strive to strengthen \\nour Armed Forces and to lead the world in various spheres. In the \\x00eld of space too, India has emerged as a \\nglobal power.\\n\\nIndia has been able to convey to the global community the unequivocal message that it considers terrorism \\nas  a  serious  threat  to  the  world  and  stands  in  solidarity  for  conce\\x00ed  action  against  the  menace  of \\nterrorism. We have also been able to convey that India will instantly give a be\\x00\\x00ing reply to any act of terror \\nthat is perpetrated against us. The world, today, sees us as a strong and emerging power. Not only have we \\nsucceeded  in  strengthening  our  Armed  Forces  with  state-of-the-a\\x00  defence  technologies,  but  also \\nbecome self-reliant in this \\x00eld.\\n\\nThe  General  Election  of  2019  is  an  election  for  carrying  forward  the  multi-dimensional  journey  of \\ndevelopment sta\\x00ed by the Narendra Modi led government. This election is signi\\x00cant because it narrates \\nthe story of a country that has faced historical wrongs before this government came to power in 2014. It is a \\ngovernment which has, since then, demonstrated that in the race of development it is not going to stop or \\nslow down.  In the journey of aspirations and trust, it is an election to select a government which has one aim \\nand objective and that is to continue with the journey of development, good governance and prosperity. \\n\\nThis election is not between two political pa\\x00ies; rather, it is an election to dissipate the negativity that \\nmakes us oblivious of our glorious past and our cultural roots and values. This election is not about victory or \\ndefeat; rather it is an election to reject those oppo\\x00unists who trample upon the hopes of the common \\npeople  for  their  personal  gains.  This  election  is  to  defeat  dynasticism,  casteism,  communalism  and \\ncorruption so that India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s democracy can be infused with greater strength.\\n\\nIn order to asce\\x00ain the future of India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s march of development, we have incorporated in our Sankalp the \\nhopes, aspirations, opinions and suggestions of crores of our fellow citizens. This Vision Document is the \\nrepresentative document of the expectations of the people of India, it gives voice to their aspirations. To \\nensure that the Vision Document of a government that bases itself on people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pa\\x00icipation and suppo\\x00, \\nalso  re\\x00ects  their  hopes  and  aspirations,  the  Manifesto  Commi\\x00ee  led  by  Shri  Rajnath  Singhji  had \\nunde\\x00aken a marathon e\\x00o\\x00. This e\\x00o\\x00 is now before you in the form of the Sankalp Patra. Each member \\nof  the  commi\\x00ee  and  every  person  associated  with  the  formulation  of  this  document  deserves \\nappreciation. \\n\\nFriends, this election is not merely to elect a government, it is an election to ensure the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s national \\nsecurity, it is an election to propel India to become among the top \\x00ve economic powers, it is an election to \\ntransform the lives of 50 crore poor Indians, it is an election to take the country forward and to make India \\ngreat in the comity of nations. \\n\\nCome, let us strengthen Shri Narendra Modi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hands, and resolve to form a full majority BJP government.\\n\\nWith Best Wishes\\n\\nAmit Shah\\nNational President, BJP\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\x0cSankalp Patra\\n\\nNote\\n\\nIt gives me immense pride and satisfaction to present to you the Bharatiya Janata Pa\\x00y\\xe2\\x80\\x99s vision document, \\nwhich is a collection of the hopes and aspirations of every Indian. This document is a compendium of our \\npromises  and  commitments  that  we  make  to  our fellow  citizens  who  stand  with  us  on  the  journey  of \\ndevelopment which India has unde\\x00aken since 2014. We have prepared this document a\\x00er an elaborate \\nand extensive discussion with people from di\\x00erent regions, communities and classes across the country \\nthrough \\xe2\\x80\\x98Bharat Ke Mann Ki Baat\\xe2\\x80\\x99, the largest ever collaborative e\\x00o\\x00 to engage citizens in cra\\x00ing the \\nroadmap of development for the next \\x00ve years. These direct suggestions from all across the country form \\nthe core of our vision document for the 2019 elections. The promises that we have made in it are our \\ncommitments to facilitate building a New India.\\n\\nIndia has moved on the path of progress at an unprecedented pace a\\x00er Prime Minister Shri Narendra \\nModi-led NDA government won a decisive mandate to form the government and serve the people of India. \\nWe are bringing to you this document at a time when our country has already embarked on the path of rapid \\nprogress under this government. It is as a result of Shri Modi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s vision of inclusive development and good \\ngovernance that we are consistently moving forward and are poised to achieve the goal of building a New \\nIndia by 2022.\\n\\nWhen the BJP government was formed in 2014, the country was faced with the challenge of turning around \\nthe wheel of development that had been stalled because of rampant corruption, misrule and indecisiveness \\nof the UPA government, under whose rule the country had been pushed into the darkness of despair. For a \\ndecade, India had a government with no clarity of intentions, lacking strong leadership which could take \\ncrucial decisions and bere\\x00 of a policy directive devoted to the welfare of the people. In the last \\x00ve years, \\nwe have been successful in li\\x00ing the country out of the morass of problems inherited from 10 years of \\nmisrule by the UPA government, while also increasing the pace of development.\\n\\nIn the last \\x00ve years, under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the NDA government has \\nsuccessfully vindicated the mandate that it won in 2014. With the will to transform the hopes of 100 million \\nof fellow citizens into a solid 'trust', we have pledged to take the country forward on the path of progress.\\n\\nA\\x00er running a government devoted to the welfare of the common citizen for \\x00ve years, we can proudly say \\nthat we have not only successfully achieved our goals, but have empowered millions of Indians to become \\nself-reliant and capable of ful\\x00lling their dreams and aspirations. This government has made historic e\\x00o\\x00s \\nmade towards empowerment of the ordinary Indian, establishment of a strong and transparent system of \\ngovernance and inculcating the spirit of unity and ful\\x00lment of the vision of \\xe2\\x80\\x98Ek Bharat , Shreshtha Bharat\\xe2\\x80\\x99.\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\x0cIn order to achieve the highest goals of agricultural development, we have unde\\x00aken the unprecedented \\nmeasure of making the agriculture sector 'farmer centric'. As a result of our e\\x00o\\x00s in this sector, we are now \\nmoving rapidly towards the goal of doubling the income of farmers by 2022. By increasing the Minimum \\nSuppo\\x00 Price of crops by 1.5 times the cost, we have ensured a fair value for their yield. Through the Prime \\nMinister Kisan Samman Nidhi, the government has provided \\x00nancial suppo\\x00 to farmers by giving them an \\nassistance of Rs. 6,000 per year, transferred directly into their bank accounts. The BJP government has also \\nensured  that  adequate  warehousing  and  marketing  oppo\\x00unities  are  available  to  farmers,  thereby \\nreducing the chances of risk to a minimum.\\n\\nIn the last \\x00ve years, the work done by our government for the development and empowerment of every \\nsection of society including women, youth and weaker sections has instilled faith in every citizen that they \\ncan move ahead on the path of progress with dignity. Prior to 2014, numerous projects lay idle for years \\nbecause the UPA government had failed to work on them. This, in turn, resulted in the decrease of both the \\nnumber and quality of basic amenities for the citizens of our country. By simplifying processes, we have \\nachieved a historic success in bringing the economy back on track. 'One Nation, One Tax' has become a \\nmilestone in the direction of indirect tax reform. Because of proactive and e\\x00ective measures taken to \\nensure the external and internal security of the country, the Prime Minister Modi-led government has given \\nrise to a sense of security in the minds of the people. By accomplishing all these tasks, we have presented \\nthe example of an accountable, sensitive and strong-willed government.\\n\\nThe  BJP  government  has  always  considered  people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  pa\\x00icipation  of  utmost  impo\\x00ance  in  good \\ngovernance and therefore ensured that people in general were given ample oppo\\x00unities for pa\\x00icipating \\nin our initiatives and voicing their opinions. With this spirit, we have made an a\\x00empt to know 'Bharat Ke Man \\nKi Baat' and taken this into account while de\\x00ning our work for the next \\x00ve years and in the formation of our \\nvision document.\\n\\nWe  connected  crores  of  people  under  the  'Bharat  Ke  Man  Ki  Baat'  dialogue  which  was  a  nationwide \\ncampaign run by the BJP for a month. Millions of suggestions were shared with us through di\\x00erent means. \\nOur manifesto is a document of expression of crores of suggestions and aspirations. With the aid of about \\n7,700 suggestion boxes, 300 rath, more than 100 dialogue program, more than 4000 'Bharat Ke Man Ki \\nBaat' program and through the social media we have made an e\\x00o\\x00 to gauge  the \\xe2\\x80\\x98Mann ki Baat\\xe2\\x80\\x99 of people \\nacross India. At the same time, we consulted many domain expe\\x00s, whose suggestions constitute the basis \\nof this vision document.\\n\\nThis vision document is the vision of an uninterrupted journey upon which we had embarked with the \\nblessings of the people in 2014. By presenting our achievements in the last \\x00ve years as a proof of our \\ndedication, we are \\x00rmly commi\\x00ed to continue that journey in the coming \\x00ve years. This vision document \\nis our plan of action for achieving these objectives and to ful\\x00l the aspirations of every Indian.\\n\\nSince this document is inspired by the \\xe2\\x80\\x98will of the people\\xe2\\x80\\x99, we dedicate it to the people by reiterating our \\nunwavering commitment and dedication to  the creation of a New India.\\n \\n\\nRajnath Singh\\nChairperson, Manifesto Commi\\x00ee\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\x0cTOWARDS A NEW INDIA\\nAs a continuing government, we will build on the foundations laid out in the last \\x00ve years in terms of re-\\nestablishing  macro-economic  stability,  building  long-term  frameworks  of  governance,  raising  India's \\ninternational stature, introducing a non-nonsense approach to internal/external security, upgrading the \\nstock of physical/social infrastructure and, most impo\\x00antly, building a basic safety net for the deprived \\nsection  of  our  society. We  have  demonstrated  what  all  can  be  achieved  by  a  commi\\x00ed  and  decisive \\nleadership that is not afraid to take hard decisions. \\n\\nIn the next \\x00ve years, we promise to create growth oppo\\x00unities for all citizens in every aspect of life. Sab ka \\nSaath, Sab ka Vikas remains our guiding principle. We intend to reach out to a developed future while \\nretaining our civilisational roots. \\n\\nIn order to achieve our long-term goals, we must \\x00rst secure our country against internal and external \\naggression. These threats need to be dealt with at their roots and our decisive leadership that will equip our \\nsecurity apparatus with all the necessary tools. As we have already demonstrated, we intend to use our \\nforeign  policy,  were  necessary,  in  order  to  tackle  the  problem  of  global  terrorism. Thus,  we  intend  to \\nincrease the strength of our diplomatic and allied cadres. We will also build on the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMake in India in Defence\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\ninitiative to fu\\x00her indigenise our defense equipment. \\n\\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi had promised, in his very \\x00rst speech in Lok Sabha, that this government \\nwould work for the welfare of the poorest. In the last \\x00ve years, we have created a transparent mechanism \\nfor directly delivering basic services to the bo\\x00om of the pyramid by leveraging Aadhaar, DBT and Jan Dhan \\naccounts.  Basic  health  has  been  a  special  focus  with  large  investments  made  on  sanitation  (Swachh \\nBharat), health insurance (Ayushmaan Bharat) and in modern medical facilities. We intend to accelerate the \\npace  of  providing  access  to  basic  amenities  such  as  housing,  electricity,  toilet,  cooking  gas,  and \\nhealth/social security to every poor Indian household, rural and urban, in the next \\x00ve years and to bring the \\npercentage of population below the pove\\x00y line to single digits. \\n\\nIn  the  last  \\x00ve  years,  we  re-imposed  macro-economic  stability  while  building  lasting  frameworks  for \\neconomic governance. These frameworks include the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code, in\\x00ation-targeting, \\nnationwide Goods & Services Tax, and the banking sector clean-up. These e\\x00o\\x00s have not only changed \\nthe business culture of the country and anchored in\\x00ation at 4 percent, but have also been internationally \\nrecognized with a sovereign rating upgrade and a sharp rise in our Ease of Doing Business ranking. We will \\nensure that India remains the world's fastest growing major economy in future while maintaining macro-\\nstability. We aspire to be the world's third largest economy by 2030.  \\n\\nSince our economic model is based on entrepreneurship and innovation, we commit to simplifying and \\nlowing tax rates. An impo\\x00ant aspect of the ease of doing business is the ability to enforce contracts and \\nresolve disputes. Therefore, we promise to signi\\x00cantly increase the capacity of the legal system within \\x00ve \\nyears in pa\\x00nership/co-ordination with the judiciary.\\n\\nThe physical infrastructure of the country has undergone an unprecedented upgrade in the last \\x00ve years. \\nWe have connected 91% of villages with rural roads, electri\\x00ed 100% of villages, operationalized 36 new \\nairpo\\x00s and introduced metro networks in several cities. Looking ahead, we plan to build 60,000 km of \\nNational Highways, connect 100% of villages with rural roads, operationalize 100 new airpo\\x00s, modernize \\n400 railway stations, and cover 50 cities with metro networks. \\n\\n9\\n\\n\\x0cAgriculture employs a large propo\\x00ion of our labour force. In order to ensure remunerative prices for \\nfarmers, the minimum suppo\\x00 price for 22 crops was increased to 1.5 times cost of production. In addition, \\nwe have curbed the large-scale diversion of subsidized farm inputs through measures like Neem-coating \\nof urea, rolled out electronic National Agriculture Market (e-NAM),  provided insurance cover to 14 crore \\nfarmers under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana and, most recently, introduced direct income suppo\\x00 \\nfor 12 crore farming families through the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi. In the next \\x00ve years, we will \\ncreate a National Warehousing Grid, invest Rs25 lakh crores in farm/rural productivity, introduce interest-\\nfree Kisan Credit Cards and extend the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi to all farmers. We remain \\ncommi\\x00ed to the promise of doubling farmer incomes by 2022 and more resources will be made available if \\nnecessary. \\n\\nIn the last \\x00ve years, we have created a national common market for the industry and services sectors. By \\nlowering in\\x00ation and cleaning up the banking system, we are now in a position to structurally lower the real \\ncost of capital. This is key to a sustained increase in private sector investment. We intend to establish a \\nNational Traders' Welfare Board as well as announce a National Policy for Retail Trade. The tourism sector will \\nbe  a  special  focus. We  will  make  sure  that  all  UNESCO World  Heritage Sites  in  India  have  facilities  of \\ninternational standard. We will also identify and promote speci\\x00c sites of cultural/natural impo\\x00ance as a \\nnational priority (while being sensitive to their preservation). \\n\\nThe cultural, ecological and social capital of a country are just as impo\\x00ant as its economic capital. These \\ntoo  need  continuous  investment  and  we  intend  to  expand  suppo\\x00  for  protecting  cultural/linguistic \\nheritage, conserving sites of ecological/historical impo\\x00ance, and promoting our civilizational ideas both \\ninternationally  and  to  the  next  generation. We  reiterate  our  stand  to  explore  all  possibilities  within  the \\nframework of the Constitution to facilitate the construction of a Ram Temple in Ayodhya. \\n\\nWe  remain  commi\\x00ed  to  ensuring  the  bene\\x00ts  of  constitutional  provisions  to  the  Scheduled  Castes, \\nScheduled  Tribes  and  backward  classes.  We  recently  introduced  a  fu\\x00her  10%  reservation  for  the \\neconomically backward sections of the non-reserved category. At the same time, we will expeditiously \\ncomplete the National Registration of Citizens in Assam and actively consider its extension to other states. \\n\\nEvery  society  progresses  through  the  empowerment  of  women,  inclusion  of  minorities  and  the \\nencouragement of youth. We will not allow these objectives to be held back by the politics of appeasement. \\nTherefore, we hope to modernize personal laws to prohibit practices such as Talaq-e-Biddat and Nikah \\nHalala. We intend to invest in our human potential by focusing on the quality of our primary/secondary \\nschools as well as expanding our te\\x00iary education capacity. In addition, we will also invest in a select set of \\nuniversities and research institutions in order make them world class. \\n\\nFor three generations, India's socio-economic system was held hostage to dynastic perpetuation. This \\npropagated a corrupt, self-servicing system of political patronage that came to pervade every aspect of \\nlife in India. In 2014, the country voted decisively to end this system. Under the leadership of PM Modi, every \\ne\\x00o\\x00 has been made to re-establish probity in public life, introduce transparency in policy-making and in \\nthe management of national assets as well as to bring o\\x00enders to book. \\n\\nThe  above  summary  is  based  on  the  vision  of  Prime  Minister  Modi  to  build  a  technologically  modern, \\nentrepreneurial,  rules-based  economy  that  is  secure  from  external/internal  security  threats  and \\nsimultaneously able to build on its cultural, ecological and social assets. \\n\\n10\\n\\n\\x0cNation First\\n\\nThe decisive leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has fundamentally altered the national \\nsecurity paradigm of India in the last \\x00ve years. Looking ahead, we propose to do the following:\\n\\nZero-Tolerance Approach to Terrorism \\n\\nOur security doctrine will be guided by our national security interest only. This is exempli\\x00ed by the \\nSurgical Strikes and the Air Strikes carried out recently. We will \\x00rmly continue our policy of \\xe2\\x80\\x98Zero \\nTolerance\\xe2\\x80\\x99 against terrorism and extremism and will continue to follow our policy of giving a free hand \\nto our security forces in combating terrorism.\\n\\nNational Security\\n\\nStrengthening our Armed Forces - We will speed up the purchases of outstanding defense related \\nequipments  and  weapons.  In  order  to  equip  the  Armed  Forces  with  modern  equipment,  we  will \\ncontinue to take focused steps to strengthen the strike capability of the Armed Forces.\\n\\nSelf-reliance  in  defence  sector  -  In  order  to  ensure  self-reliance  in  procurement  of  defence \\nequipment, we have taken several e\\x00ective steps in the last \\x00ve years. For instance, the most modern \\nAK-203  automatic  ri\\x00es  are  being  manufactured  at Amethi  under  our  'Make  in  India  in  Defence' \\ninitiative. We are commi\\x00ed to focus on 'Make in India in Defence' to enable indigenous production of \\ndefence equipment. This will also generate employment and encourage investment in the defence \\nsector.\\n\\nWelfare of Soldiers\\n\\nWe  have  already  demonstrated  our  commitment  to  the  welfare  of  our  veterans  with  the \\nimplementation of long delayed OROP. To take this commitment forward, we promise to create a more \\ne\\x00ective framework for the rese\\x00lement of our Armed Forces veterans. Under this e\\x00o\\x00, the Armed \\nForces will sta\\x00 planning for the rese\\x00lement of soldiers three years before their retirement and in \\naccordance with their preferences. This will include provision for skills training, so\\x00 skills training, \\n\\x00nancial suppo\\x00 for higher education, for housing and for sta\\x00ing an enterprise.\\n\\nModernization of Police Forces\\n\\nWe will continue to take forward the process of modernizing the Central Armed Police Forces to \\nfu\\x00her increase their capacity and readiness and enable them to e\\x00ectively combat internal security \\nchallenges.\\n\\nWe  will  provide  assistance  to  the  states  to  upgrade  their  police  forces  through  the  \\xe2\\x80\\x98Scheme  for \\nModernization of Police Forces\\xe2\\x80\\x99. We will encourage expedited police reforms in the states so as to \\nenable the State police forces to deal with new types of crimes like cyber crime and help them to be \\nmore sensitive to the citizens, especially the weak and vulnerable sections of the society.\\n\\nCombating In\\x00ltration\\n\\nThere  has  been  a  huge  change  in  the  cultural  and  linguistic  identity  of  some  areas  due  to  illegal \\nimmigration,  resulting  in  an  adverse  impact  on  local  people's  livelihood  and  employment. We  will \\nexpeditiously complete the National Register of Citizens process in these areas on priority. In future we \\nwill implement the NRC in a phased manner in other pa\\x00s of the country.\\n\\nWe will continue to unde\\x00ake e\\x00ective steps to prevent illegal immigration in the No\\x00heastern states. \\nFor this, we will fu\\x00her strengthen our border security. A pilot project on the use of technology to \\nstrengthen border security (Sma\\x00 Fencing) was implemented in Dhubri (Assam). We will implement \\nthis on all borders.\\n\\n01\\n\\n02\\n\\n03\\n\\n04\\n\\n05\\n\\n06\\n\\n07\\n\\n08\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\x0c09\\n\\n10\\n\\n11\\n\\n12\\n\\n13\\n\\nReinforcing Border Security\\n\\nWe will focus on creation of developmental and other necessary infrastructure in border areas to \\nensure that border security is strengthened, and to enable increased pa\\x00icipation of and bene\\x00ts for \\nborder areas in the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s development and progress.\\n\\nWe have completed building six integrated check-posts with another under construction to facilitate \\neasier trade and travel from the neighboring countries. We will fu\\x00her ease the movement of goods \\nand people by constructing 14 more integrated check-posts by 2024. A\\x00er completion of all the \\nproposed integrated check-posts, all trade movement with Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan will be \\nconducted through the integrated check-posts.\\n\\nCoastal Safety\\n\\nA\\x00er e\\x00ectively strengthening coastal security through implementation of a coastal security scheme \\nto  provide  modern  equipment  and  allocating  funds  to  the  states  for  establishing  coastal  police \\nstations, establishment of National Commi\\x00ee for Strengthening Maritime & Coastal Security, Island \\nInformation System  and  National Academy  of Coastal  Policing,  we  will  continue  to  take  steps for \\nensuring security of India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s long coastline.\\n\\nCitizenship Amendment Bill\\n\\nWe  are  commi\\x00ed  to  the  enactment  of  the  Citizenship  Amendment  Bill  for  the  protection  of \\nindividuals of religious minority communities from neighbouring countries escaping persecution. We \\nwill make all e\\x00o\\x00s to clarify the issues to the sections of population from the No\\x00heastern states who \\nhave expressed apprehensions regarding the legislation. We reiterate our commitment to protect the \\nlinguistic, cultural and social identity of the people of No\\x00heast. Hindus, Jains, Buddhists and Sikhs \\nescaping persecution from India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s neighbouring countries will be given citizenship in India.\\n\\nCombating Le\\x00 Wing Extremism\\n\\nWe have already taken strong actions to reduce le\\x00 wing extremism to a very large extent and limited \\nthem to small pockets. We are commi\\x00ed to taking necessary and e\\x00ective steps against le\\x00 wing \\nextremism to eliminate this menace in the next \\x00ve years. In the last \\x00ve years, we have focussed on \\nthe development of economic and social infrastructure such as roads, mobile towers, schools and \\nmedical facilities in the tribal areas a\\x00ected by le\\x00 wing extremism and we will continue to make \\ne\\x00o\\x00s in this direction.\\n\\nJammu & Kashmir- A\\x00icle 370\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\xc5\\xb8\\n\\nIn the last \\x00ve years, we have made all necessary e\\x00o\\x00s to ensure peace in Jammu and Kashmir \\nthrough decisive actions and a \\x00rm policy. We are commi\\x00ed to overcome all obstacles that come \\nin the way of development and provide adequate \\x00nancial resources to all the regions of the state. \\nWe reiterate our position since the time of the Jan Sangh to the abrogation of A\\x00icle 370. \\n\\n\\xc5\\xb8 We  are  commi\\x00ed  to  annulling  A\\x00icle  35A  of  the  Constitution  of  India  as  the  provision  is \\ndiscriminatory against non-permanent residents and women of Jammu and Kashmir. We believe \\nthat A\\x00icle 35A is an obstacle in the development of the state. We will take all steps to ensure a safe \\nand peaceful environment for all residents of the state. We will make all e\\x00o\\x00s to ensure the safe \\nreturn of Kashmiri Pandits and we will provide \\x00nancial assistance for the rese\\x00lement of refugees \\nfrom West Pakistan, Pakistan occupied Jammu and Kashmir (POJK) and Chhamb.\\n\\nIndia suppo\\x00s peace, \\nbut the country will not hesitate to take \\nany steps required for national security\\n- Shri Narendra Modi\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\x0cDoubling Farmers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Income \\n\\nAt the very beginning of our current term, Prime Minister Modi embarked on a mission to double \\nfarmers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 income.

We  will  establish  a  network  of  mobile  veterinary \\ndispensaries to provide doorstep service to farmers.\\n\\n23\\n\\n24\\n\\n25\\n\\n26\\n\\n27\\n\\n28\\n\\n29\\n\\nWe  will  roll  out  a  model  programme for  periodic  health  checkup  of  all  ca\\x00le  and  other  domestic \\nanimals at the district level with the help of veterinary expe\\x00s from the public and private sector.\\n\\nWe will expand the coverage of immunization and eliminate Foot and Mouth Disease and Brucellosis.\\n\\nWe will launch a National Feed and Fodder Mission to eliminate the sho\\x00age of fodder.\\n\\nFisheries - Blue Revolution\\n\\nWe will launch \\xe2\\x80\\x98Matsya Sampada Yojana\\xe2\\x80\\x99 with an allocation of Rs. 10,000 crores to ensure availability of \\nstorage and marketing tools and infrastructure like ice-boxes, cold storages, ice-plants etc. for small \\nand traditional \\x00shermen.\\n\\nWe will promote aquaculture through easy access to credit.\\n\\nWe will facilitate farming of sea-weed, pearl as well as ornamental \\x00sh to ensure a be\\x00er return to the \\n\\x00shermen.\\n\\nWe will bring all \\x00shermen under the ambit of all welfare programmes and social security schemes \\nwith expanded coverage for accident insurance.\\n\\n15\\n\\n\\x0cOn the Path of Gram Swaraj\\n\\nGram Swaraj is one of the principal pillars of Mahatma Gandhi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s vision of India. As we approach the \\n150th bi\\x00h anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, Bharatiya Janata Pa\\x00y resolves to realize his vision of \\nGram Swaraj  by  ensuring  that  everyone  has  equitable  access  to  resources. As  India  reaches  the \\nde\\x00ning milestone of the 75th year of its independence in 2022, we pledge to adopt the ideals of Gram \\nSwaraj as envisaged by Mahatma Gandhi. In line with this vision we promise:\\n\\nSaashray \\n(Housing)\\n\\nWe will ensure a pucca house to \\n\\nevery family who are either \\n\\nliving in a kuchha house or have \\nno access to housing by 2022.\\n\\nSuchna se Sashaktikaran \\n\\n(Digital connectivity \\nthrough Bharatnet)\\n\\nWe will ensure that every Gram \\nPanchayat is connected through \\n\\na high speed optical \\x00bre \\n\\nnetwork by 2022. \\n\\nSujal \\n\\n(Drinking Water)\\n\\nWe will launch \\xe2\\x80\\x98Jal Jivan Mission\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\nunder which we will introduce a \\nspecial program, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Nal se Jal\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to \\nensure piped water connection \\n\\nto every household by 2024.\\n\\nSadak se Samriddhi \\n\\n(Road connectivity)\\n\\nWe will launch a massive \\xe2\\x80\\x98Rural \\nRoad Upgradation Programme\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\n\\nto connect centres of \\n\\neducation, healthcare centres, \\nand markets with hinterlands to \\n\\npromote rural growth.\\n\\nSwachhata se Sampannata \\n\\n(Swachh Bharat Mission)\\nWe will ensure 100% disposal of \\nliquid waste water and reuse of \\n\\nwaste water.\\n\\n16\\n\\n\\x0cIndia as the World\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 3rd Largest Economy\\n\\nRoadmap for 5 trillion dollar economy\\n\\n01\\n\\n02\\n\\nIndia was branded as \\xe2\\x80\\x98fragile \\x00ve\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in 2014. Within \\x00ve years, we have turned India into a bright spot that \\nis not only the fastest growing major economy of the world but also enjoys macroeconomic stability. \\nWe have already become the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sixth largest economy and will soon be among the top \\x00ve. We \\naspire to make India the third largest economy of the world by 2030. This implies that we commit to \\nmake India a US $ 5 trillion economy by 2025 and US $ 10 trillion economy by 2032.\\n\\nWhen compared to all governments post-1991, this government has delivered the highest rate of \\naverage GDP growth (7.3%) over the last \\x00ve years and maintained lowest rate of average consumer \\nin\\x00ation (4.6%). The consumer in\\x00ation is presently at 2.6%. This has been achieved with lower \\x00scal \\nde\\x00cits and signi\\x00cantly lower current account de\\x00cit as a percentage of GDP. Average \\x00scal de\\x00cit \\nas a percentage of GDP during 2014-19 has been brought down  to 3.7% from 5.4% during 2009-14. \\nReduction in \\x00scal de\\x00cit of this order implies less burden of debt on future generations by almost \\nRs.16 lakh crores. Average Current account de\\x00cit as a percentage of GDP during this government has \\nbeen reduced to 1.5% from 3.3% during 2009-14.  \\n\\nTax Policy\\n\\n03 Our  economic  policy  has  been  guided  by  the  principle  of  lowering  the  tax  rate  and  improving \\ncompliance; thereby broadening of the tax base. With improved compliance and increased tax base, \\nthe  tax  to GDP  ratio  has  reached  12%,  highest  in  the  recent  past,  up from  10.1%  in  2013-14. This \\nincreased revenue has been deployed for bene\\x00ts to the poor and creation of infrastructure at an \\nunprecedented level. We will continue with our policy in the similar manner \\xe2\\x80\\x93 lowering of tax rate \\nthereby rewarding honest tax payers and improving compliance.\\n\\nGoods and Service Tax\\n\\n04 Goods and Service Tax (GST) has resulted in overall lowering of tax rates and increased revenue \\ncollection, pa\\x00icularly for States. When compared to base year of 2015-16, GST revenue for all states \\nhave increased by 50% in three years. We will continue with the simpli\\x00cation of GST process by \\nengaging in dialogue with all stakeholders. \\n\\nPromoting Yoga Globally\\n\\n05 We will fu\\x00her continue our e\\x00o\\x00s to promote Yoga globally as the world celebrates 21st June as the \\nInternational Yoga  Day. We  will  promote Yoga  as  a  vital  method  to  achieve  physical  wellness  and \\nspiritual rejuvenation across the globe and will continue to work towards training of Yoga practitioners. \\nWe will unde\\x00ake a rapid expansion of Yoga health hubs, Yoga tourism and research in Yoga. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x82\\xb9100 lakh crore Investment\\n\\n06\\n\\nWhile social security net for the poor and farmers will be expanded, we will take up capital investment \\nin the country to a new height. By 2024, we will make capital investment of Rs.100 lakh crore in the \\ninfrastructure sector. We recognize that investment driven growth requires cheaper cost of capital. By \\nanchoring in\\x00ation at 4% and cleaning up our banking system we have created the space for structural \\nreduction in the cost of capital. This will not only help infrastructure investment but investment also in \\nthe wider economy.  Thus, new India will be built on the basis of investment driven growth.\\n\\n17\\n\\n\\x0cMake In India \\n\\n07\\n\\nWith  the  aim  of  developing  India  into  a  knowledge  based,  skill  suppo\\x00ed  and  technology  driven \\nsociety, we have launched the \\xe2\\x80\\x98Make in India\\xe2\\x80\\x99 campaign. A beginning has already been made through \\nour initiatives like Digital India, Sta\\x00up India and Skill India. To bring in fast and inclusive growth, we \\nhave  also  carried  out  substantial  reforms  in  the  last few  years  in  terms  of  de-regulation  and  de-\\nlicensing,  with  an  aim  to  improve  ease  of  doing  business.  More  than  90%  FDI  approvals  are  now \\nthrough  the  automatic  route.    FDI  has  grown  by  almost  50%  in  the  last  \\x00ve  years.  Similarly, \\nimplementation of One Nation, One Tax through GST has brought all businesses under single tax net. \\n\\n08\\n\\nMaking India a global manufacturing hub - as we position India as a global manufacturing hub over \\nthe next \\x00ve years, we will take the following steps:\\n\\n\\xc5\\xb8 Top 50 Ranking in Ease of Doing Business Index- In the last four years, India has climbed 65 places \\nin the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index. We will fu\\x00her work in this direction to take the \\ncountry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ranking into the top 50.\\n\\n\\xc5\\xb8 Strengthening Companies Act  -  In  order  to  incentivize  compliance  of  law  and  ease  of  doing \\nbusiness, we will amend the Companies Act to impose civil liability for technical and procedural \\ndefaults of a minor nature thus unclogging the majority of the cases from the cou\\x00s.\\n\\n\\xc5\\xb8 New Industrial Policy - We will announce a new industrial policy to improve competitiveness of \\nmanufacturing and services with an eye on Industry 4.0 in order to gear up for technologies like \\na\\x00i\\x00cial intelligence and electric mobility. Special e\\x00o\\x00 will be made for MSMEs.\\n\\n\\xc5\\xb8 Network  Approach  for  Growth  -  We  understand  that  clustering  and  network  e\\x00ects  are \\nimpo\\x00ant in order to build competitiveness in cu\\x00ing edge industries. Therefore, we will invest in \\ncreating  clusters/networks  that  can  take  on  the  world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  best.  Public  procurement    and \\ngovernment incentives will be used actively to build up these clusters and encourage job creation. \\n\\nMicro, Small and Medium Enterprises \\n\\n09\\n\\n10\\n\\nA special package was launched by the Government to boost the MSME sector. The Credit Guarantee \\nScheme  of  the  Government  of  India  is  an  impo\\x00ant  component  wherein  loans  to  MSME  are \\nguaranteed.  Under this alone, the credit of around Rs.19,000 crore was achieved in 2017-18.  We would \\naim to take this \\x00gure to Rs.1,00,000 crore by 2024.\\n\\nTechnology access and upgradation are key elements in the MSME sector.  Our government has taken \\na major step in expanding  of \\xe2\\x80\\x98Technology Centres\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and we would achieve more than 150 such centres \\nall over the country by 2024.  These Technology Centres would help in mentoring skilling and proto-\\ntyping of MSMEs.  They will expose MSMEs to A\\x00i\\x00cial Intelligence, Robotics, Internet of Things, Vi\\x00ual \\nReality, BlockChain technology and Zero Defect Zero E\\x00ect.\\n\\n11\\n\\nThe Technology Centres, other skilling centres of MSMEs and NSICs incubation centres alone would \\nprovide focussed and high level skilling to more than 6 lakh people per year.  \\n\\n12\\n\\nWelfare of Small Traders - \\n\\n\\xc5\\xb8 We will establish National Traders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Welfare Board and create a National Policy for Retail Trade for \\n\\n\\xc5\\xb8 To protect the interests of small traders, we will provide an accident insurance of 10 lakh rupees to \\n\\n\\xc5\\xb8 On the lines of Kisan credit card, we will also create a scheme to give merchant credit card to \\n\\nthe growth of retail businesses.\\n\\nall the traders registered under GST. \\n\\nregistered merchants. \\n\\n18\\n\\n\\x0cEntrepreneurship & Sta\\x00Ups\\n\\n13\\n\\nTo  encourage  the  spirit  of  entrepreneurship  amongst  the  youth,  we  will  launch  a  new  scheme  to \\nprovide collateral-free credit up to \\x0050 lakh for entrepreneurs. We will guarantee 50% of the loan \\namount for female entrepreneurs and 25% of the loan amount for male entrepreneurs.\\n\\n14\\n\\nIndia  is  now  among  the  largest Sta\\x00up  ecosystems  of  the  world. We  will fu\\x00her  strengthen  this \\necosystem by: \\n\\n\\xc5\\xb8 Easing regulatory requirement for sta\\x00-ups \\n\\xc5\\xb8 Targeting time spent for tax compliance at 1 hour per month \\n\\xc5\\xb8 Facilitating establishment of 50,000 new Sta\\x00ups in the nation by 2024  \\n\\xc5\\xb8 Creating 100 Innovation Zones in Urban Local Bodies\\n\\xc5\\xb8 Se\\x00ing up 500 new incubators and accelerators by 2024\\n\\xc5\\xb8\\n\\nInitiating ranking of Central Ministries, depa\\x00ments, State Governments and CPSUs for their \\nincreased engagement with sta\\x00-ups and in bringing in innovation and newer technologies and \\nglobal practices and skills. \\n\\n15\\n\\n16\\n\\n We will continue to promote and encourage Sta\\x00ups through creation of a \\xe2\\x80\\x98Seed Sta\\x00up Fund\\xe2\\x80\\x99 of \\n\\xe2\\x82\\xb920,000 crore.\\n\\nWe will suppo\\x00 entrepreneurial ventures sta\\x00ed by individuals from Scheduled Castes, Scheduled \\nTribes, Other Backward Communities, or Economically Weaker Sections and take forward the \\xe2\\x80\\x98Stand-\\nup India\\xe2\\x80\\x99 initiative.\\n\\n17\\n\\nWe will set-up new 'Entrepreneurial No\\x00heast' scheme to provide \\x00nancial suppo\\x00 to the micro, small \\nand medium industries and for employment generation in the No\\x00heastern state.\\n\\nUsing Tourism to Cluster Services\\n\\n18\\n\\n19\\n\\n20\\n\\nWithin the services sector, tourism will be special focus because it brings together many di\\x00erent \\nservice segments.\\n\\nIn pa\\x00icular, we will identify speci\\x00c places of cultural or natural impo\\x00ance in order to develop them \\nas comprehensive destinations instead of leaving them as isolated sites. This requires that we look at \\ntranspo\\x00 connection, heritage conservation, hotels, restaurants, ente\\x00ainment and other services in \\nan integrated way. We will make an e\\x00o\\x00 to ensure that all these services interconnect. Therefore, the \\ngovernment will make sure that schemes/ agencies such as Swachh Bharat, ASI, forest depa\\x00ment \\nand local government work together with the travel and hospitality   industry. All UNESCO heritage \\nsites in India will be upgraded to international level facilities.\\n\\nThe  No\\x00h  eastern  states  and  our  Island/coastal  areas  will  be  developed  while  being  sensitive  to \\nconserving  their  ecological  uniqueness. Similarly,  places  of  cultural  impo\\x00ance  will  be  developed \\nwhile maintaining their unique heritage. As we have recently demonstrated by projects in Varanasi, an \\ne\\x00o\\x00 will be made to upgrade these sites while being sensitive to their historical/cultural heritage.\\n\\nTransparent economy\\n\\n21\\n\\nWe will continue our crackdown on Benami prope\\x00ies and illegal foreign bank accounts to bene\\x00t \\nhonest  taxpayers  and  the  poor  of  the  country. We  will  also  expedite  our  actions  to  bring fugitive \\neconomic o\\x00enders back to India and prosecute them for their crimes.\\n\\nInternational Trade\\n\\n22\\n\\nWe  will  ensure faster  customs  clearance  of  international  cargo  by  relaxing  clearance  procedures, \\nintroducing  self-declaration  etc  and  adopting  new  scanning  technology.  We  will  also  provide \\nadequate \\x00nancial and institutional suppo\\x00 for expo\\x00ers and expo\\x00 organizations to build capacity \\nand equip them with adequate information to ensure unhindered expo\\x00s.\\n\\n19\\n\\n\\x0cInfrastructure \\n\\nFoundation for New India\\n\\nInfrastructure  is  the  backbone  of  any  economy.  In  the  10  years  of  UPA  rule,  policy  paralysis  and \\ncorruption had derailed infrastructural development. The last \\x00ve years, under the leadership of  Prime \\nMinister Modi, infrastructural roll out has been put back on track. For the \\x00rst time, India has sta\\x00ed \\nmarching and is being seen on the path of global standards in infrastructure and civic amenities. The \\nspeed of constructing rural roads has doubled and 90% of rural road connectivity has been achieved. \\nFu\\x00hermore, India has become a net expo\\x00er of electricity and has achieved maximum production of \\ncoal  and  maximum  distribution  of  LED  bulbs. There  has  been  an  unprecedented  rise  in  the  po\\x00 \\ncapacity and the speed of se\\x00ing up new rail lines, gauge conversion, and electri\\x00cation of railway \\ntracks has doubled. We have invested at an unprecedented level in building infrastructure in the last \\n\\x00ve years.  This includes massive budgetary allocation for railways, highways, village roads and other \\nhealth as well as educational infrastructure. We have also sta\\x00ed and matured into a new technology \\ndriven pla\\x00orm called PRAGATI (Pro-active Governance and Timely Implementation). Through this, \\nmechanism, we are de-bo\\x00lenecking major projects on a regular basis through video conference with \\no\\x00cials across the country. Going forward,\\n\\n01\\n\\n02\\n\\nWe will aim at next generation infrastructure which will include gas grids and water grids, i-ways, \\nregional airpo\\x00s and way side amenities along National highways.\\n\\nWe will continue the fast pace with more and more public and private investment and e\\x00cient ground \\nlevel management on building of infrastructure fu\\x00her and to improve the quality of life and enhance \\nthe ease of living.\\n\\n03\\n\\nIn addition to ensuring e\\x00ciency in the economy this will also lead to creation of a large number of jobs \\nand livelihood oppo\\x00unities.\\n\\nEnsuring Urban Development\\n\\n04\\n\\nThrough the development of infrastructure and connectivity, we will ensure the fu\\x00her development \\nof suburban townships and new urban centres.\\n\\n05\\n\\n06\\n\\nWe will set up \\x00ve regional centres of excellence on urban issues. These centres will provide suppo\\x00 to \\nstates and local bodies on issues of urban governance and growth.\\n\\nUrban Mobility -We will launch a National Urban Mobility Mission to provide technology based urban \\nmobility  solutions  to  all  urban  local  bodies  and  increase  the  use  of  public  transpo\\x00,  enhance \\nwalkability and cycle use. Under this mission, we will incentivize cities to integrate the public transpo\\x00 \\nsystems such as metro, local trains and local buses with the private service providers in the sector such \\nas, private bus operator, private taxi operator, the auto-rickshaw, e-rickshaw services, pedestrian and \\ncycling  infrastructure  for  a  seamless  and  smooth  last  mile  connectivity.  We  will  also  promote  a \\ncommon mobility card/ ticketing across di\\x00erent modes of transpo\\x00.\\n\\n07\\n\\nIn the next \\x00ve years, we will ensure that 50 cities are covered with a strong metro network. \\n\\nSwachh Bharat Mission\\n\\n08\\n\\nWe have constructed over 9 crore toilets under our \\x00agship programme, Swachh Bharat Mission. We \\nwill take the Mission to a new level through sustainable Solid Waste Management in every village. \\nThrough the mission, we will ensure 100% disposal of liquid waste through emphasis on faecal sludge \\nmanagement and reuse of waste water in rural, peri urban and unsewered areas.\\n\\n09\\n\\nWe will ensure that all habitations a\\x00ain open defecation free status and those that have a\\x00ained the \\nstatus sustain the behavioural change. \\n\\n20\\n\\n\\x0cJal Shakti\\n\\nWater is a critical resource but its management is spread across various depa\\x00ments, even at the \\nCentral  level. We  will form  a  new  Ministry  of Water  unifying  the  water  management functions  to \\napproach the issue of water management holistically and ensure be\\x00er coordination of e\\x00o\\x00s. The \\nMinistry will expeditedly take forward the ambitious programme, conceptualized by Shri Atal Bihari \\nVajpayee, for linking rivers from di\\x00erent pa\\x00s of the country and ensure a solution to the problems of \\ndrinking water and irrigation. We will initiate work on this programme by constituting an authority.  \\n\\nWe will launch \\xe2\\x80\\x98Jal Jivan Mission\\xe2\\x80\\x99 under which we will introduce a special programme, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Nal se Jal\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to \\nensure piped water for every household by 2024.\\n\\nWe will ensure sustainability of water supply through special focus on conservation of rural water \\nbodies and ground water recharge.\\n\\nRoad Connectivity\\n\\nIn continuation to our existing milestone of constructing roads at an unprecedented pace, we will \\nconstruct 60,000 kms of National Highways in the next \\x00ve years.\\n\\nWe will double the length of National Highways by 2022.\\n\\nWe will complete the Phase-1 of Bharatmala Project expeditiously. We will also launch Bharatmala 2.0 \\nproject especially with a view to suppo\\x00 the states to develop state road networks connecting the \\ninterior regions to the main roads and to e\\x00ectively leverage the economic potential and market \\noppo\\x00unities of the concerned regions.\\n\\nWe will bring in new technologies and designs in road construction, operation and maintenance.\\n\\nWe want to become a world leader in e-mobility. \\x0010,000 crores have already been allocated to launch \\na programme for promoting clean energy and ba\\x00ery operated vehicles. We will fu\\x00her work on this \\nfront to ensure expansion of this new mobility experience. \\n\\nRailways\\n\\nWe have made all e\\x00o\\x00s to make the experience of rail journey safe, smooth, clean and satisfying and \\nhave achieved great results. We will continue the pace of work in this regard and encourage private \\npa\\x00icipation in the development of railway amenities and infrastructure and provision of services. \\n\\nWe will ensure conversion of all viable rail tracks to broad gauge by 2022.\\n\\nWe will make all e\\x00o\\x00s to ensure electri\\x00cation of all railway tracks by 2022.\\n\\nWe will expand connectivity and experience of high speed trains and new version trains such as Vande \\nBharat Express across the length and breadth of the country in the next \\x00ve years.\\n\\nWe will complete the dedicated freight corridor project by 2022. \\n\\nWe will launch a massive programme for modernization of railway stations in the country.\\n\\nWe will equip all main railway stations with Wi-Fi facility by 2022.\\n\\n10\\n\\n11\\n\\n12\\n\\n13\\n\\n14\\n\\n15\\n\\n16\\n\\n17\\n\\n18\\n\\n19\\n\\n20\\n\\n21\\n\\n22\\n\\n23\\n\\n24\\n\\n21\\n\\n\\x0cEstablishment of New Airpo\\x00s\\n\\n25\\n\\nIn 2014 there were 65 functional airpo\\x00s and there are a total of 101 functional airpo\\x00s today. In the \\nnext \\x00ve years, we will double the number of functional airpo\\x00s.\\n\\nCoastal Development\\n\\n26\\n\\n27\\n\\n28\\n\\n29\\n\\nPotential of coastal development for transpo\\x00ation, tourism and for economic upli\\x00ment of coastal \\ncommunities has remained unexploited in the country. To exploit this potential fully, we have launched \\nthe Sagarmala programme and will ensure speedy completion of the projects under this programme.\\n\\nWe will double our po\\x00 capacity in the next \\x00ve years.\\n\\nWe will fu\\x00her encourage integrated development of coastal areas including coastal cities, coastal \\ntranspo\\x00 and coastal industrialization. \\n\\nWe will unde\\x00ake the upgradation of infrastructure for connecting the coast and hinterland to ensure \\nsmooth transpo\\x00ation. \\n\\n30\\n\\nWe will continue to focus on development of inland waterways for shi\\x00ing inland cargo movement \\nfrom road and rail to water transpo\\x00.\\n\\nEnergy\\n\\n31\\n\\n32\\n\\n33\\n\\nWe  had  made  a  commitment  to  provide  24x7  electricity  to  all  and  the  country  has  substantially \\na\\x00ained  the  goal.  All  remaining  villages  have  been  electri\\x00ed.  Similarly,  almost  all  remaining \\nhouseholds have been provided with an electricity connection. Thus, we are near completion of our \\npromise in a record time. We will fu\\x00her work towards completing any un\\x00nished task in this regard. \\n\\nExceptional  work  has  been  done  in  adding  to  the  electricity  generated  and  in  laying  down  of \\ntransmission  lines  and  in  pu\\x00ing  up  the  nationwide  transmission  grid.  With  these  milestone \\nachievements, India can now claim that quantum of or access to electricity is no longer an issue. In fact, \\nIndia has also become a net expo\\x00er of electricity. Now, we will work towards:\\n\\xc5\\xb8 Ensuring a right mix of energy which leads towards a cleaner environment\\n\\xc5\\xb8 Supplying quality electricity to all consumers\\n\\xc5\\xb8 Making the state electricity entities \\x00nancially sound and administratively more e\\x00cient.\\n\\nIndia has become a global champion in addressing the issues of climate change through e\\x00ective and \\nfeasible interventions. We have achieved cumulative installed renewable energy capacity of 76.87 GW \\nas on February, 2019 and are on track to achieve our goal of 175 GW by 2022. We will continue our \\ne\\x00o\\x00s in this regard and make it a popular movement. We will fu\\x00her make all e\\x00o\\x00s to invite other \\ncountries of the world to become members of the International Solar Alliance.\\n\\nDigital Connectivity\\n\\n34\\n\\nEvery Gram Panchayat will be connected with high speed optical \\x00bre network by 2022. Through \\nvillage level high speed broadband services, we will provide a range of services such as telemedicine, \\ntele-education and agriculture related advisories. \\n\\n22\\n\\n\\x0cHealth for All\\n\\nPrime Minister Sh. Narendra Modi took a historic step last year through the roll out of Ayushman Bharat \\nthe  World\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  largest  healthcare  programme.  In  addition,  we  have  conceived  and  implemented \\nprogrammes for controlling prices of medicines, and signi\\x00cantly expanding Medical education. We \\nare commi\\x00ed to leverage all resources to ensure that the out-of-pocket expenditure on health is \\nreduced and all citizens can avail necessary medical services.\\n\\nMaking Healthcare Accessible \\n\\n01\\n\\nWhile providing annual health cover of Rs. 5 lakh to 10.74 crore poor families under the Pradhan Mantri \\nJan Arogya Yojana under Ayushman Bharat, we also initiated a programme to set up 1,50,000 Health \\nand Wellness Centres (HWCs) by 2022.  Till date 17,150 HWCs have become functional.  We will take up \\nthe programme of HWCs to next level.   We will target provisioning of telemedicine and diagnostic \\nlaboratory facilities at these HWCs by 2022 to ensure quality primary medical care to the poor at his \\ndoorstep.\\n\\n02\\n\\nWe will create an essential devices list and a separate pricing policy for medical devices to ensure their \\naccessibility and a\\x00ordability to masses. \\n\\nStrengthening Health Infrastructure\\n\\n03\\n\\n04\\n\\nWith our initiatives, we have successfully reached the stage of ensuring one Medical College for every \\nthree Parliamentary Constituencies. We will take it forward and set up one Medical College or Post \\nGraduate Medical College in every district, through public or private pa\\x00icipation, by 2024.  To sta\\x00 \\nwith 75 such Medical Institutes will be set up by 2022.  This would ensure availability and accessibility \\nof quality secondary and te\\x00iary medical care to the citizens across the diverse landscape of our \\ncountry.  \\n\\nIn a mere span of 5 years, we have increased the number of MBBS seats by 18,000 and that of Post-\\ngraduate  Medical  seats  by  12,000.   We  would fu\\x00her  accelerate  the  pace  of  reforms  in  medical \\neducation sector so as to ensure transparency on one hand and improved doctor: population ratio on \\nthe other hand.   With our e\\x00o\\x00s we will double the number of MBBS and Specialist doctors in the \\ncountry by 2024 as compared to the work done from 1947 till 2014.  Fu\\x00her, we will also accelerate the \\nreforms in para-medical education sector so as to increase the availability of nurses, pharmacists and \\nother paramedical personnel.\\n\\n05\\n\\nWe will also accelerate the reforms in paramedical education sector so as to increase the availability of \\nnurses, pharmacists and other paramedical personnel. \\n\\nImmunization and Nutrition \\n\\n06\\n\\n07\\n\\n08\\n\\nWe  will  endeavour  to  make  the  National  Nutrition  Mission  a  mass  movement  and  strengthen \\ninfrastructure and capacity in all Anganwadis.\\n\\nThe Mission Indradhanush programme has ensured full immunization of 3.39 crore children and 87.18 \\nlakh pregnant mothers.  Fu\\x00her, the annual increase in the rate of immunization has jumped from 1% \\nper year to 6% per year. Continuing this pace, we will ensure full immunization coverage for all the \\nchildren and pregnant women by 2022. \\n\\nEliminating Tuberculosis\\n\\nTuberculosis claims more lives every year than any other infectious disease.  As on today, more than 25 \\nlakh citizens are su\\x00ering from TB while over 3 lakh persons die due to TB every year.   The disease \\nmainly a\\x00ects the poor and malnourished.  We have rolled out a Special Mission to eliminate TB from \\nIndia by 2025.  We will ensure this becomes a success much ahead of the target given in Sustainable \\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs)\\n\\n23\\n\\n\\x0cGood Governance\\n\\nPrime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has always maintained that Good Governance is the cornerstone of \\ngood politics. In the last \\x00ve years, we have put in place a framework of governance which will yield rich \\ndividends over the next generation.\\n\\nSimultaneous Elections \\n\\nWe are commi\\x00ed to the idea of simultaneous elections for Parliament, State assemblies and local \\nbodies  to  reduce  expenditure,  ensure  e\\x00cient  utilisation  of  government  resources  and  security \\nforces and for e\\x00ective policy planning. We will try to build consensus on this issue with all pa\\x00ies.\\n\\nSingle Voter List - In order to ensure that every citizen gets the right to exercise his/her franchise for all \\npublic bodies and to avoid confusion created by multiple voter lists, we will strive to ensure a common \\nvoter list for all elections. \\n\\nCorruption-free Bharat\\n\\nIn order to curb corruption, the Modi government has taken many e\\x00ective steps such as enacting the \\nFugitive Economic O\\x00enders Act,2018, Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act,2018,   and   the \\nBenami Transaction Prohibition (Amendment) Act, 2016. We have eliminated ine\\x00ia in the government \\nby ensuring decisive actions under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi and will continue to make \\ne\\x00o\\x00s to ensure more e\\x00ective governance and transparent decision making.\\n\\n01\\n\\n02\\n\\n03\\n\\nCivil Service and Governance Reforms\\n\\n04\\n\\nTo transform India into a developed nation, we need to work with the guiding principle of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMinimum \\nGovernment and Maximum Governance\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and we will bring reform in the Civil Services and implement \\nit  in  a  manner  to  achieve  the  same.  In  order  to  ensure  be\\x00er  implementation  of  policies  and \\ncoordination, we will merge similar and complementary depa\\x00ments into sectoral ministries. This will \\nallow policymakers to frame holistic and comprehensive policies on the one hand and ensure smooth \\nimplementation on the other.\\n\\n05\\n\\nWe will continue to implement the Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan in a focussed manner to build the \\ncapacity of members of Panchayati Raj Institutions and ensure e\\x00ective delivery of schemes at the \\ngrassroots. \\n\\nPolice reforms \\n\\n06\\n\\nPolice  is  the  most  basic  and  key functionary  a\\x00ecting  the  people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  life. An  e\\x00ective  policing  and \\npeaceful law and order is the key to growth and development. Our present police and policing is based \\nupon the colonial police force and there is a need to change and transform the police according to the \\nchallenges of the 21st century. Therefore, we will bring Police Reform. We will formulate a \\xe2\\x80\\x98Model Police \\nAct\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in consultation with the States to have a pro-people citizen friendly police. This will take the Indian \\npolicing at par with its contemporaries anywhere in the world.\\n\\nJudicial Reforms\\n\\n07\\n\\nWe will work towards simplifying procedural laws, encouraging mediation and strengthening judicial \\nand cou\\x00 management system in order to increase accessibility. \\n\\n24\\n\\n\\x0c08\\n\\nMaking India the centre of arbitration - We will increase the number of Alternative Dispute Resolution \\nforums to ensure avenues for quick disposal of ma\\x00ers. We will also take all necessary steps to make \\nIndia a hub of arbitration services.\\n\\nInternational Financial Services Centre Authority\\n\\n09\\n\\nIn order to establish India as a hub of \\x00nancial services, we will expedite the enactment of legislation \\nfor  creating  an  International  Financial  Services  Centre  Authority  which  will  put  in  place  a  robust \\nregulatory framework. We will continue and fu\\x00her increase the ongoing incentives to expand digital \\ntransactions.\\n\\nImplementing Cooperative Federalism E\\x00ectively\\n\\n10\\n\\nWe have set an example of inclusive federal governance through steps such as the creation of NITI \\nAayog, establishment of the GST council and restructuring of central schemes in line with our pledge \\nof cooperative federalism. We will continue to pursue this course by ensuring greater involvement of \\nthe states in all aspects of policy making and governance thereby strengthening federalism. We will \\nalso ensure implementation of the 14th Finance Commission\\xe2\\x80\\x99s recommendations.\\n\\nEase of Living\\n\\n11\\n\\n12\\n\\n13\\n\\n14\\n\\n15\\n\\n16\\n\\n17\\n\\n18\\n\\nWe will set up a commi\\x00ee for Easing Citizens\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Interactions with Government (CECIG) to work with \\nexpe\\x00s in reforming citizen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inte\\x00ace with Government across domains such as taxes, business \\ncompliance, rules and regulations for greater simplicity and ease.\\n\\nTo empower citizens and ensure time-bound delivery of public services, we will explore every avenue \\nto implement the Right to Service. \\n\\nScience and Technology\\n\\nThe future belongs to Science and Technology and the use of technology for development of people. \\nWe  will  launch  a  new  Science  Mission  for  development  of  cu\\x00ing  edge  technologies  and  future \\ntechnologies with two submissions, speci\\x00cally focused on (a) a\\x00i\\x00cial intelligence mission and (b) \\nrobotic research mission with the aim to leapfrog into the future world of cu\\x00ing edge technologies.  \\n\\nOur \\x00rst agenda is our people. Today much of our S&T investment is in central institutions. We will aim \\nto spread this to the 95% of students who a\\x00end state government institutions also. This will be done \\nby  investment from  the  government  through  a  National  Research  Foundation  in  pa\\x00nership  with \\nStates. Industry investment in R&D will also be enhanced, in pa\\x00nership with our network of national \\nlaboratories. \\n\\nWe  will  launch  a  Language Translation  Mission  that  will  enable  ready  translation  of  English  text  in \\nScience & Technology and humanities in any of our languages. This will take the best works, bilingually, \\nto every student in the country.  \\n\\nWe will initiate a genome mission for human health that will bring the latest diagnosis and treatment to \\nour entire population through frugal innovation.  \\n\\nWe will explore the diversity of our oceans, have a human crewed submersible going to the deepest \\noceans that will facilitate sustainable use of resources. With a thrust on non-fossil fuels, our research \\nmission in this area will reduce impo\\x00s and make India a leader in new technologies. \\n\\nThe supercomputer, A\\x00i\\x00cial Intelligence and Quantum Missions will make India not only Industry 5.0 \\nready but also a leader. The Swachh Bharat mission has transformed one side of Swachhata. Now we \\nwill get the latest technologies to transform Waste to Energy and Wealth in a major mission. We will also \\nstrive towards semiconductor manufacturing within the country.\\n\\n25\\n\\n\\x0c19\\n\\nA\\x00er achieving unprecedented success through Mission Shakti, we are commi\\x00ed to ensuring that \\n'Gaganyaan' successfully demonstrates our scienti\\x00c capabilities of executing a manned mission in \\nspace. We will sta\\x00 the 'National Program for Rapid Research in Socially Contextual Technologies' to \\ncreate  research  paths  in  desirable  technologies  and  to  manage  \\x00nancing  of  such  projects  in \\ncoordination with the private sector.\\n\\nForest and Environment\\n\\n20\\n\\n21\\n\\n22\\n\\nWe have ensured speed and e\\x00ectiveness in issuing forest and environmental clearances for eligible \\nprojects due to which we have added around 9000 Sq. Kms to the forest cover of the country. We are \\ncommi\\x00ed  to  maintaining  this  pace  through  adoption  of  cleaner  practises  to  make  our  nation  a \\ngreener country. \\n\\nWe have evolved technologically be\\x00er strategies and devices to map the level of pollution in cities \\nand rivers and have taken e\\x00ective steps to reduce the level of pollution in major cities, including the \\nnational capital. We will conve\\x00 the National Clean Air Plan into a Mission and we will focus on 102 most \\npolluted cities in the country. Through conce\\x00ed action, we will reduce the level of pollution in each of \\nthe mission cities by at least 35% over the next \\x00ve years. \\n\\nWe have continuously protected and promoted the interest of forest dwellers pa\\x00icularly the tribal \\ncommunities. We have endeavoured to provide basic amenities, such as roads, telephone connectivity \\nand  cooking  gas  connection  in  addition  to  houses  and  toilets,  at  the  doorstep  of  people  living  in \\nremotest forest areas. We are commi\\x00ed to continuing our work in this direction.\\n\\nProtecting the Himalayas\\n\\n23\\n\\nWe will ensure the Himalayan States are provided special \\x00nancial assistance in the form of a 'Green \\nBonus' to facilitate the protection and promotion of forests in those states.\\n\\nFocussing on Island Territories\\n\\n24\\n\\n25\\n\\nWe have taken impo\\x00ant steps such as establishing the Island Development Authority to ensure the \\noverall  development  of  the  island  regions.  We  will  continue  to  focus  on  these  areas  given  their \\neconomic potential and strategic impo\\x00ance.\\n\\nWe will preserve the unique identity of Andaman-Nicobar and Lakshadweep Islands and build a world-\\nclass  infrastructure  compatible  with  the  local  ecosystem.  We  will  focus  on  fully  developing  the \\npotential of tourism in these islands to bring transformational improvement in the standard of living \\nand income of the residents.\\n\\nFocussing on Union Territories\\n\\n26\\n\\nWe will develop Union Territories as models of development and good governance, and ensure the \\nhighest quality of living, citizen services and infrastructure for the residents of Union Territories.\\n\\nDevelopment of No\\x00heastern States\\n\\n27\\n\\n28\\n\\nWe have ensured that the insurgency in the No\\x00heastern States is brought under control and the \\nsecurity  situation  in  these  states  improved  signi\\x00cantly. We  will  leverage  this  situation  to  ensure \\naccelerated development of the No\\x00heastern states.\\n\\nWe will continue to focus on the development of infrastructure and improved connectivity in this \\nregion  to  ensure  that  the  No\\x00heastern  states  duly  pa\\x00icipate  in  the  economic  progress  of  the \\ncountry. We will continue to take the necessary steps to leverage the tremendous potential of hydro-\\nelectric, tourism, ho\\x00iculture etc in the No\\x00heastern states.\\n\\n29\\n\\nWe are commi\\x00ed to ensure that the unique linguistic, cultural and social identity of the No\\x00heastern \\nStates is adequately protected and take steps to ensure the same.\\n\\n26\\n\\n\\x0cYuva Bharat - Tomorrow\\xe2\\x80\\x99s India\\n\\nWe need to create stepping stones for the next-generation in order to ensure that they can pa\\x00icipate \\nmore fully in building New India. \\n\\nCreating Oppo\\x00unities for Youth \\n\\n01\\n\\nWe  will  create  new  oppo\\x00unities  of  employment  by  providing  more  suppo\\x00  to  the  22  major \\n'Champion Sectors' identi\\x00ed as the main drivers of Indian economy. We will optimally leverage the \\nuntapped employment-generation of potential of sectors such as defence and pharmaceuticals to \\ntake advantage of the oppo\\x00unities available in domestic and foreign markets.\\n\\n02\\n\\nEntrepreneurship & Sta\\x00Ups- To encourage the spirit of entrepreneurship amongst the youth, we \\nwill take the following steps : \\n\\n\\xc5\\xb8 We will launch a new scheme to provide collateral-free credit up to \\xe2\\x82\\xb950 lakh for entrepreneurs. We \\nwill guarantee 50% of the loan amount for female entrepreneurs and 25% of the loan amount for \\nmale entrepreneurs.\\n\\n\\xc5\\xb8 We will set-up new 'Entrepreneurial No\\x00heast' scheme to provide \\x00nancial suppo\\x00 to the micro, \\n\\nsmall and medium industries and for employment generation in the No\\x00heastern state. \\n\\n\\xc5\\xb8 More than 17 crore entrepreneurs have availed loans under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana. We \\n\\nwill expand this initiative fu\\x00her to take the number of bene\\x00ciaries of Mudra loans up to 30 crore.\\n\\n\\xc5\\xb8 We will continue to promote and encourage Sta\\x00ups through creation of a \\xe2\\x80\\x98Seed Sta\\x00up Fund\\xe2\\x80\\x99 of \\n\\n\\xe2\\x82\\xb920,000 crore.\\n\\nYouth In Governance \\n\\n03\\n\\nEngaging Youth with Society - To ensure increased pa\\x00icipation of youth in our society, we will take \\nthe following steps : \\n\\n\\xc5\\xb8 We will incentivise and reward self-organized groups of youth who adopt social assets like schools, \\nhospitals, lakes, public gardens etc. and ensure their maintenance and cleanliness to encourage \\ngreater civic engagement of the youth.\\n\\n\\xc5\\xb8 We will launch a special awareness and treatment programme for de-addiction among youth to \\n\\nprotect them from the harmful e\\x00ects of substance abuse and addiction  \\n\\n04\\n\\nYouth in Urban Governance - We will suppo\\x00 a large scale internship programme for the youth in \\nurban local bodies, matching skills needed by the local bodies and providing the young with much \\nneeded understanding of urban issues.\\n\\nSpo\\x00s\\n\\n05\\n\\n06\\n\\nWe  will  map  state  and  district-wise  spo\\x00  talent  and  strengths,  recognize  the  traditional  spo\\x00ing \\npractices and focus on the promotion of speci\\x00c spo\\x00s in speci\\x00c regions.\\n\\nOur  government  has  taken  comprehensive  steps  to  develop  the  culture  of  spo\\x00s  in  the  country \\nthrough the 'Khelo India' scheme, and we will continue to provide adequate resources under this \\nscheme to ensure the achievement of declared objectives. Under this scheme, special a\\x00ention will be \\ngiven to encourage spo\\x00ing talent among women and tribals.\\n\\n27\\n\\n\\x0c07\\n\\n08\\n\\n09\\n\\nIn order to fu\\x00her promote spo\\x00s, we will introduce practical spo\\x00s courses as pa\\x00 of the educational \\ncurriculum  and  also  establish  a  National  Spo\\x00s  Education  Board  for  the  development  of \\nspo\\x00spersons.\\n\\nWe will suppo\\x00 the creation of a mini-stadium in each sub-district, with the pa\\x00icipation of state \\ngovernments, to encourage spo\\x00s and to make spo\\x00ing infrastructure available in the rural areas.\\n \\nWe will formulate a mechanism to ensure that the capacity of existing spo\\x00ing infrastructure is easily \\naccessible  for  use  of  spo\\x00spersons  and  new  models  including  PPP  will  be  explored  to  ensure \\nmaintenance and management of such assets.\\n\\n10\\n\\nWe will promote the Fit India campaign as an integral pa\\x00 of building a culture of spo\\x00s in India and will \\nconsistently unde\\x00ake necessary steps to encourage broader awareness and pa\\x00icipation in the \\ncampaign.\\n\\nIndia is a youthful country. \\nA country with such a major\\npercentage of youth has the \\ncapability to change not only \\nits own, but the fate of the\\nentire world. \\n- Shri Narendra Modi\\n\\n28\\n\\n\\x0cEducation for All\\n\\nWhile  keeping  the  education  system  in  pace  with  modern  trends  and  knowledge,  our  e\\x00o\\x00s  will \\ncontinue to be oriented towards ensuring a global, scienti\\x00c, outcome-focused, knowledge-oriented, \\naccessible,  inclusive  and  student-friendly  education  system  in  order  to  ensure  that  students  can \\noptimally bene\\x00t from the education system.\\n\\nPrimary and Secondary Education\\n\\nHaving  achieved  access  and  equity  in  school  education,  our  emphasis  will  now  be  on  quality  of \\nlearning. We have already identi\\x00ed learning outcomes for various classes and our priority in the next \\n\\x00ve years will be to ensure that children achieve these learning outcomes. We will focus on teachers \\ntraining and capacity building as a key factor in achieving these learning outcomes.\\n\\nWe consider it our duty to provide a conducive environment for talented children in our country to \\nfacilitate them to unleash their talent. For this, we will initiate a \\xe2\\x80\\x98Prime Minister Innovative Learning \\nProgram\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to bring together such children for a ce\\x00ain period in a year in one place from all over the \\ncountry and provide them with facilities and resources for them to excel. This would instill a culture of \\nlateral thinking and innovation among them. \\n\\nWe will establish National Institutes of Teachers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 training. These institutions would provide four-year \\nintegrated  courses  that  would  set  the  standards  for  quality  teachers  in  our  schools. We  will  also \\nmotivate States to replicate this model as it is our \\x00rm belief that quality teachers lay the foundation of \\nquality learning.\\n\\nWe are commi\\x00ed to using technology in classrooms and in impa\\x00ing education. We will move ahead \\nto provide sma\\x00 classes to our children in schools. To begin with, we will initiate this process in the \\nsecondary classrooms.  \\n\\nKendriya  Vidayalalas  and  Navodaya  Vidayalas  have  done  yeoman  service  in  the  \\x00eld  of  school \\neducation. In order to cater to the demands of more such schools, we aim to open another 200 such \\nschools by 2024.\\n\\n Higher Education \\n\\nWe will take all necessary steps to increase the number of seats in Central Law, Engineering, Science \\nand Management institutions by at least 50% in the next \\x00ve years. We will also motivate States to \\naccordingly increase the number of seats in State institutions.\\n\\nWe have given due emphasis to on-line courses as a medium of delivering education in the last \\x00ve \\nyears.  We will take it to the next level and make it a major resource for impa\\x00ing higher education. \\n\\nWhile  we  have  world-class  Technology,  Science  and  Medical  institutions,  the  same  needs  to  be \\nreplicated in other areas. We will set up an A\\x00s, Culture and Music University with a focus on \\x00ne a\\x00s \\nsuch as music and dance. We will also open a state-of-the-a\\x00 Hospitality and Tourism University and a \\nPolice University. States will be encouraged to establish similar institutions of excellence.\\n\\nWe  will  relook  the  role  of  existing  regulatory  institutions\\xe2\\x80\\x99  and  make  necessary  changes  in  the \\nlegislation to ensure a regulatory overhaul. We will formulate new regulatory mechanism to provide \\nautonomy to quality institutions and focus towards se\\x00ing national standards. It will work towards \\npromoting  excellence  and  quality  learning  in  higher  education  while  providing  academic  and \\nfunctional autonomy to institutions.\\n\\n01\\n\\n02\\n\\n03\\n\\n04\\n\\n05\\n\\n06\\n\\n07\\n\\n08\\n\\n09\\n\\n29\\n\\n\\x0c10\\n\\n11\\n\\n12\\n\\n13\\n\\n14\\n\\nIn the past \\x00ve years, our emphasis has been on quality higher educational institutions and Institutions \\nof Eminence have been a step in that direction. We will take it forward in the next \\x00ve years and create \\n50 such institutions by 2024.\\n\\nIn the past 5 years, a number of our institutions have \\x00gured in the top 500 institutions of the world. We \\nwill encourage academic institutions towards excellence and motivate more such institutions to rank \\namong the top 500 institutions of the world.\\n\\nWe will consciously promote a programme for \\xe2\\x80\\x98Study in India\\xe2\\x80\\x99, which will focus on bringing foreign \\nstudents to study in higher educational institutions in our country and make India a major destination \\nfor education for foreign students.\\n\\nTo ensure innovation and quality research, we will incentivise the industry to collaborate with our \\nscienti\\x00c labs and technological institutions, to unde\\x00ake research in cu\\x00ing-edge technology and \\nscience.\\n\\nWe have launched the \\xe2\\x80\\x98National Digital Library of India\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and provided access to e-books and many \\nother papers to the students free-of-cost. To fu\\x00her promote a research-orientation in our higher \\neducation institutions, we will take it forward by providing access to leading journals free of cost to the \\nstudents.\\n\\n Skill Development\\n\\n15\\n\\nWe will formulate a \\xe2\\x80\\x98National Policy for Reskilling and Upskilling\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to evolve a \\x00exible and industry-\\nresponsive  workforce  which  is  capable  of  accessing  new  oppo\\x00unities  and  to  insulate  it  from \\ntechnological shocks.\\n\\n30\\n\\n\\x0cWomen Empowerment\\n\\nAs, The Prime Minister has stated that \\xe2\\x80\\x98India needs not just women development, but women-led \\ndevelopment that makes women the leading force of our development trajectory\\xe2\\x80\\x99, and as per this \\nbelief, we have determinedly gone beyond tokenism to take substantive measures to ensure overall \\ndevelopment of women and achieve gender equality. Building on these positive measures we will \\ncontinue  to  pursue  the  course  of  holistic  development  and  increased  pa\\x00icipation  of  women  in \\nsociety and economy. \\nWomen-led Development\\n\\nThe gains made under our pioneering \\xe2\\x80\\x98Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao\\xe2\\x80\\x99 programme have been impressive. \\nWe are commi\\x00ed to continue to build on these gains to provide accessible and a\\x00ordable quality \\neducation to all women. We will ensure that ample \\x00nancial suppo\\x00 is available to girls through out \\ntheir education and subsidised education loans are provided for higher education. \\n\\nDuring the last \\x00ve years, we have focussed on ensuring a safe and digni\\x00ed life and access to basic \\nresources for women through various schemes such as Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Ujjwala, Pradhan \\nMantri Awas Yojana, Saubhagya. In the next 5 years, to ensure \\x00nancial empowerment among women \\nin rural and semi-rural areas and create be\\x00er employment oppo\\x00unities for them, we will make every \\ne\\x00o\\x00  to  ensure  access  to  credit  and  other  resources,  capacity  building,  market  and  distribution \\nnetwork for women entrepreneurs, SHGs and women farmers.\\n\\nWe are commi\\x00ed to make women equal pa\\x00ners in and equal bene\\x00ciaries of the progress and \\nprosperity of the nation and will formulate a comprehensive \\xe2\\x80\\x98Women in Workforce\\xe2\\x80\\x99 roadmap focussed \\non dramatically increasing the female workforce pa\\x00icipation rate over the next \\x00ve years. We will also \\nencourage industries and corporates to generate be\\x00er employment oppo\\x00unities for women. \\n\\nTo  generate  be\\x00er  work  oppo\\x00unities  for  women,  10%  material  to  be  sourced  for  government \\nprocurement will be done from MSMEs having at least 50% women employees in their workforce.This \\nwill cover various impo\\x00 substitution items including, but not limited to, apparel, leather, paper and \\nwood, a\\x00icles, stone items like idols, etc, plastic and rubber items, furniture, clocks, toys etc. \\n\\nTo ensure greater pa\\x00icipation of women in the workforce, it is necessary to enable them to continue \\nin the workforce by providing suppo\\x00 for child care. Our government has already made it mandatory \\nfor  any  establishment  with  50  or  more  employees  to  have  the  facility  of  a  creche.   We  will  now \\nstrengthen  the  creche  programme  with  special  focus  on  the  needs  of  parents  employed  in  the \\nunorganized sector to provide cr\\xc3\\xa8che and child care facilities by leveraging the existing Anganwadis, \\ncivil society organisations and the private sector. We will ensure that the number of childcare facilities \\nis increased three fold by 2022.\\n\\nEnsuring Equal Rights\\n\\nWe have determinedly taken substantive measures to ensure overall development of women and \\npromote gender equality. Continuing our work, we will legislate a bill to prohibit and eliminate practices \\nsuch as Triple Talaq and Nikah Halala.\\n\\nEnsuring a Digni\\x00ed Life for Women\\n\\nContinuing our e\\x00o\\x00s to ensure safe motherhood through schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Matru \\nVandana Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Matritva Suraksha Abhiyaan and Ayushman Bharat, we will focus on \\nensuring good quality, easily accessible and a\\x00ordable maternal healthcare services for all women.\\n\\nThe government has launched a major initiative on malnutrition by launching the POSHAN Abhiyan. \\nWe  will  reduce  the  malnutrition  level  by  at  least  10%  in  the  next  \\x00ve  years,  doubling  the  rate  of \\nreduction of malnourishment.\\n\\n01\\n\\n02\\n\\n03\\n\\n04\\n\\n05\\n\\n06\\n\\n07\\n\\n08\\n\\n31\\n\\n\\x0c09\\n\\n10\\n\\n11\\n\\n12\\n\\n13\\n\\n14\\n\\nWe will ensure that all reproductive and menstrual health services are easily available to all women \\nacross India and with the expansion of ongoing Suvidha scheme, sanitary pads at an a\\x00ordable cost of \\njust Rs. 1 will be provided to all women and girls.\\n\\nWe  have  very  signi\\x00cantly  increased  the  honararium  of  ASHA  and  Anganwadi  workers.  We  will \\nincrease the coverage of Ayushman Bharat to include all Anganwadi workers and ASHA workers to \\nensure improved health and social suppo\\x00 system for these frontline workers. \\n\\nWomen's security will be given more priority.

Five years ago, on 26th May 2014, we commenced our journey to transform our great nation and do justice  to the historic mandate bestowed upon us.  At  that  time,  India's  challenges  were  monumental-  our  economy  was  in  the  doldrums,  the  nation  was  among the fragile \\x00ve, pessimism and despair was all-pervasive and corruption was rampant. There were  serious doubts in the minds of many about India's ability to ful\\x00ll the dreams and aspirations of her citizens.  But, if challenges were enormous, so was our resolve to build a stronger, safer and prosperous nation.  Powered  and  inspired  by  the  strengths  and  skills  of  130  crore  Indians,  we  conve\\x00ed  obstacles  into  oppo\\x00unities, decay into development and pessimism into positivity.   At an unimaginable speed and scale, what seemed impossible earlier soon became a reality. In the last \\x00ve  \\x00ve years, every Indian family got a bank account due to Jan Dhan Yojana, 50 crore Indians got health  insurance thanks to Ayushman Bharat and more than 40 crore people in the unorganised sector  can now  avail pension coverage. A subject like cleanliness ignited the imagination of the nation and now we are close  to 99% sanitation coverage, compared to a mere 38% in 2014. It is now possible for youngsters from smaller  towns to become entrepreneurs thanks to Mudra Yojana. The rising neo-middle and middle class with  taxable income upto Rs. 5 lakhs no longer need  to pay income tax.  Our Government \\x00lled the infrastructure gaps with speed and foresight. The pace of construction of roads  and railway lines has doubled. India has now more e\\x00cient po\\x00s. 18,000 villages living in darkness till 2014  are now brightly lit thanks to rural electri\\x00cation e\\x00o\\x00s. More than 2.6 crore homes have been electri\\x00ed  through Saubhagya Yojana. Over 1.5 crore homes built over the last \\x00ve years have enabled millions to  dream big.  The nation is no longer helpless against the barbaric forces of terror. Any destructive ideology that destroys  the atmosphere of peace and unity is and will be given a be\\x00\\x00ing reply. They are being paid back in their own  coin, with compound interest.   India's  No\\x00heast,  which  earlier  made  headlines  for  blockage  and  neglect,  is  now  witnessing  unprecedented development. The No\\x00heast is now closer to the national mainstream in more ways than  one.   3  \\x0cThe Central Government has waged a determined crusade against the scourge of corruption and black  money. The culture of middlemen roaming in the corridors of power is now history. Decisions are guided by  public interest of all Indians and not the self-interest of a select few. The trinity of Jan Dhan- Aadhaar and  Mobile has weeded out over 8 crore fake bene\\x00ciaries, and prevented leakages of more than Rs. 1   lakh  crore. Systems have been strengthened to prevent money laundering. The corrupt have begun to realize  that their machinations will no longer be tolerated.  One can clearly see how development has become a mass movement. Numerous people friendly decisions  have led to the empowerment of 130 crore Indians and the safeguarding of our strategic interests.   Today, India stands tall at the international level. The world recognizes India's immense potential, which is  clearly re\\x00ected in a record rise in foreign investment. India's stand on subjects like terrorism, climate  change and prevention of money laundering are se\\x00ing the global narrative.  Friends,   Through this Sankalp Patra, you would get a glimpse of the challenges of the yesteryears, the indomitable  e\\x00o\\x00s made by 130 crore Indians to overcome those challenges and our collective vision for the future.   We have achieved a lot in the last \\x00ve years and we want to do lot more. There are two commitments that I  am extremely passionate about- doubling of farmer income and housing for all, by the year 2022. With your  suppo\\x00, I am sure both will happen.  I thank lakhs of ale\\x00, commi\\x00ed and patriotic citizens of India, who have enriched the Sankalp Patra with  their valuable inputs. This  Sankalp Patra is the voice of the people in the truest sense.  Your vote in 2014 for a strong and decisive government enabled us to \\x00ll some of the biggest sho\\x00comings  of \\x00ve decades of dynastic rule in a sho\\x00 span of just \\x00ve years. Now that these sho\\x00comings have been  successfully addressed, imagine the pace at which we can work in the times to come.  The  next  \\x00ve  years  are  crucial  because  in  2022,  we  mark  the  75th  anniversary  of  our  Independence.  Generations of great women and men laid down their lives so that we could  breathe the air of freedom. It is  our sacred duty to create the India of their dreams.   In 2047, our nation would complete a hundred years of freedom. Let us together imagine what is the kind of  India that we want by 2047. The BJP pledges to make the next \\x00ve years as the foundation laying period for  India of 2047. Let us together lay the foundations of this vision now, and work earnestly towards translating  this vision into a golden reality.   Having seen the work of di\\x00erent political pa\\x00ies and ideologies, the people of India are convinced that if  there is one pa\\x00y that can address  their problems, it is the BJP. The Mantra of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas' has  resonated across the length and breadth of India. BJP is a pa\\x00y for every Indian. It is a Pa\\x00y that works 24/7  at the grassroots level. That is why, the suppo\\x00 we have received has been  historic and unprecedented New India has broken from the shackles of the past. Today, we are a nation that is daring to dream and  dreaming to dare. There is an air of hope and a spirit of aspiration among the youth.   Together, let us work towards building a strong and inclusive India, whose citizens are assured of dignity,  prosperity, security and oppo\\x00unity.   Vande Mataram!   Narendra Modi  4  \\x0cPresident’s  Note  Bharatiya Janata Pa\\x00y is commi\\x00ed to Indian values, to making Antyodaya (Garib Kalyan) a reality and to  re-establishing the ideals of nation building. Our promises originate from our \\x00ve commitments (Panch- Nishtha). We have an ideology that inspires us to ful\\x00l our promises, which are not just limited to elections  and election manifestos. Inclusive development, good governance, national security, promotion of our  cultural heritage at a global level and continuance of a multi-dimensional progress are the salient features  of our ideology that continues to be a pa\\x00 of our promises and commitments to the nation. None of the  vision documents or manifestos of the Bharatiya Janata Pa\\x00y are either temporary or a mere pile of papers.  Every single word wri\\x00en in our manifesto signi\\x00es our commitment to the nation and its people.  Bharatiya Janata Pa\\x00y has been active in public sphere for decades guided by the ideological foundation  laid down by Dr Syama Prasad Mookerjee and carried forward by Pt. Deendayal Upadhyaya through his  mission of Antyodaya (Garib Kalyan) . Whenever our pa\\x00y has received the mandate of the Indian people to  govern the country, we have served the people and ful\\x00lled their wishes with full sincerity and commitment.  Under Atalji’s leadership, when the BJP-led NDA government won the mandate to govern the country, our  pa\\x00y ensured that the bene\\x00ts of development and good governance reach the last citizen at the bo\\x00om  of the societal ladder. Antyodaya (Garib Kalyan) remains Bharatiya Janata Pa\\x00y’s path, its resolve and goal.   Today, when we are ushering in the biggest festival of democracy - the General Elections of 2019, I would  like to dwell on the resolves made by the BJP. In 2014, when the BJP presented its Vision Document before  the people, India’s march of development had already been derailed because of the UPA government’s  inaction and policy paralysis. It was a phase when the hope of seeing a corruption free and transparent  government  realised  seemed  impossible.  Nobody  was  ready  to  believe  that  multi-dimensional  developmental goals could be achieved without reso\\x00ing to corruption. However, the government led by  Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi turned this belief into a reality by successfully running the government in  a  transparent  manner.  We  have  succeeded  in  conveying  this  message  to  the  people  at  large  that  governance is possible without corruption.  In 2014, Shri Narendra Modi emerged as the symbol of the aspirations of the people of India and we made  some promises. Today, when we are at this juncture of elections and facing the electorate, I can asse\\x00 with  immense pride and satisfaction that the journey of resolves and commitments that began in 2014 will  continue to be carried forward in accordance with the wishes of the people. We have succeeded in kindling  faith towards development in the minds of people and have convinced them that the Narendra Modi led  BJP government is the harbinger of a New India.   The same people who used to once say, “Nothing can  happen  in  this  country”,  are  now  hopeful  and  say,  “We  can  do  more”  while  standing  united  for  the  development of India.   It has been seen in the past that even if a government continues to govern the country for a period of twenty  years, it succeeds in taking one or two historic decisions. In its tenure of \\x00ve years, the government led by  Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has been able to take many decisions which are historic and has ushered  in a comprehensive and fundamental transformation. Swachh Bharat Mission, Ujjawala Yojana, Saubhagya  Yojana, Demonetisation, GST, Surgical Strikes, Air Strikes, total electri\\x00cation, provision for housing for 2.5  crore families, health insurance under Ayushman Bharat for more than 50 crore people and disbursement   5  \\x0cof loans to more than 14 crore people under MUDRA Yojana are some of the historic achievements of our  government. The Congress led UPA government could never have dreamt of achieving, let alone envisaging  such watershed policy initiatives. The idea of ful\\x00lling the basic necessities of every ordinary citizen is  intrinsic to our pa\\x00y’s ideology.   In  last  \\x00ve  years  our  government  has  done  incredible  work  in  establishing  a  transparent  system  of  governance,  fu\\x00hering  economic  development  and  increasing  people’s  pa\\x00icipation  in  the  country’s  progress. Today, India is the sixth largest economy in the world and from the point of view of ease of doing  business we have emerged as one of the best destinations in the world. India’s prestige on the global stage  is at an all-time high since Independence. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, we  have been able to make an India that our friends praise, our competitors respect and our enemies fear. India  is now in a position to adopt an independent stand on national security, to successfully strive to strengthen  our Armed Forces and to lead the world in various spheres. In the \\x00eld of space too, India has emerged as a  global power.  India has been able to convey to the global community the unequivocal message that it considers terrorism  as  a  serious  threat  to  the  world  and  stands  in  solidarity  for  conce\\x00ed  action  against  the  menace  of  terrorism. We have also been able to convey that India will instantly give a be\\x00\\x00ing reply to any act of terror  that is perpetrated against us. The world, today, sees us as a strong and emerging power. Not only have we  succeeded  in  strengthening  our  Armed  Forces  with  state-of-the-a\\x00  defence  technologies,  but  also  become self-reliant in this \\x00eld.  The  General  Election  of  2019  is  an  election  for  carrying  forward  the  multi-dimensional  journey  of  development sta\\x00ed by the Narendra Modi led government. This election is signi\\x00cant because it narrates  the story of a country that has faced historical wrongs before this government came to power in 2014. It is a  government which has, since then, demonstrated that in the race of development it is not going to stop or  slow down.  In the journey of aspirations and trust, it is an election to select a government which has one aim  and objective and that is to continue with the journey of development, good governance and prosperity.   This election is not between two political pa\\x00ies; rather, it is an election to dissipate the negativity that  makes us oblivious of our glorious past and our cultural roots and values. This election is not about victory or  defeat; rather it is an election to reject those oppo\\x00unists who trample upon the hopes of the common  people  for  their  personal  gains.  This  election  is  to  defeat  dynasticism,  casteism,  communalism  and  corruption so that India’s democracy can be infused with greater strength.  In order to asce\\x00ain the future of India’s march of development, we have incorporated in our Sankalp the  hopes, aspirations, opinions and suggestions of crores of our fellow citizens. This Vision Document is the  representative document of the expectations of the people of India, it gives voice to their aspirations. To  ensure that the Vision Document of a government that bases itself on people’s pa\\x00icipation and suppo\\x00,  also  re\\x00ects  their  hopes  and  aspirations,  the  Manifesto  Commi\\x00ee  led  by  Shri  Rajnath  Singhji  had  unde\\x00aken a marathon e\\x00o\\x00. This e\\x00o\\x00 is now before you in the form of the Sankalp Patra. Each member  of  the  commi\\x00ee  and  every  person  associated  with  the  formulation  of  this  document  deserves  appreciation.   Friends, this election is not merely to elect a government, it is an election to ensure the country’s national  security, it is an election to propel India to become among the top \\x00ve economic powers, it is an election to  transform the lives of 50 crore poor Indians, it is an election to take the country forward and to make India  great in the comity of nations.   Come, let us strengthen Shri Narendra Modi’s hands, and resolve to form a full majority BJP government.  With Best Wishes  Amit Shah National President, BJP  6  \\x0cSankalp Patra  Note  It gives me immense pride and satisfaction to present to you the Bharatiya Janata Pa\\x00y’s vision document,  which is a collection of the hopes and aspirations of every Indian. This document is a compendium of our  promises  and  commitments  that  we  make  to  our fellow  citizens  who  stand  with  us  on  the  journey  of  development which India has unde\\x00aken since 2014. We have prepared this document a\\x00er an elaborate  and extensive discussion with people from di\\x00erent regions, communities and classes across the country  through ‘Bharat Ke Mann Ki Baat’, the largest ever collaborative e\\x00o\\x00 to engage citizens in cra\\x00ing the  roadmap of development for the next \\x00ve years. These direct suggestions from all across the country form  the core of our vision document for the 2019 elections. The promises that we have made in it are our  commitments to facilitate building a New India.  India has moved on the path of progress at an unprecedented pace a\\x00er Prime Minister Shri Narendra  Modi-led NDA government won a decisive mandate to form the government and serve the people of India.  We are bringing to you this document at a time when our country has already embarked on the path of rapid  progress under this government. It is as a result of Shri Modi’s vision of inclusive development and good  governance that we are consistently moving forward and are poised to achieve the goal of building a New  India by 2022.  When the BJP government was formed in 2014, the country was faced with the challenge of turning around  the wheel of development that had been stalled because of rampant corruption, misrule and indecisiveness  of the UPA government, under whose rule the country had been pushed into the darkness of despair. For a  decade, India had a government with no clarity of intentions, lacking strong leadership which could take  crucial decisions and bere\\x00 of a policy directive devoted to the welfare of the people. In the last \\x00ve years,  we have been successful in li\\x00ing the country out of the morass of problems inherited from 10 years of  misrule by the UPA government, while also increasing the pace of development.  In the last \\x00ve years, under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the NDA government has  successfully vindicated the mandate that it won in 2014. With the will to transform the hopes of 100 million  of fellow citizens into a solid 'trust', we have pledged to take the country forward on the path of progress.  A\\x00er running a government devoted to the welfare of the common citizen for \\x00ve years, we can proudly say  that we have not only successfully achieved our goals, but have empowered millions of Indians to become  self-reliant and capable of ful\\x00lling their dreams and aspirations. This government has made historic e\\x00o\\x00s  made towards empowerment of the ordinary Indian, establishment of a strong and transparent system of  governance and inculcating the spirit of unity and ful\\x00lment of the vision of ‘Ek Bharat , Shreshtha Bharat’.  7  \\x0cIn order to achieve the highest goals of agricultural development, we have unde\\x00aken the unprecedented  measure of making the agriculture sector 'farmer centric'. As a result of our e\\x00o\\x00s in this sector, we are now  moving rapidly towards the goal of doubling the income of farmers by 2022. By increasing the Minimum  Suppo\\x00 Price of crops by 1.5 times the cost, we have ensured a fair value for their yield. Through the Prime  Minister Kisan Samman Nidhi, the government has provided \\x00nancial suppo\\x00 to farmers by giving them an  assistance of Rs. 6,000 per year, transferred directly into their bank accounts. The BJP government has also  ensured  that  adequate  warehousing  and  marketing  oppo\\x00unities  are  available  to  farmers,  thereby  reducing the chances of risk to a minimum.  In the last \\x00ve years, the work done by our government for the development and empowerment of every  section of society including women, youth and weaker sections has instilled faith in every citizen that they  can move ahead on the path of progress with dignity. Prior to 2014, numerous projects lay idle for years  because the UPA government had failed to work on them. This, in turn, resulted in the decrease of both the  number and quality of basic amenities for the citizens of our country. By simplifying processes, we have  achieved a historic success in bringing the economy back on track. 'One Nation, One Tax' has become a  milestone in the direction of indirect tax reform. Because of proactive and e\\x00ective measures taken to  ensure the external and internal security of the country, the Prime Minister Modi-led government has given  rise to a sense of security in the minds of the people. By accomplishing all these tasks, we have presented  the example of an accountable, sensitive and strong-willed government.  The  BJP  government  has  always  considered  people’s  pa\\x00icipation  of  utmost  impo\\x00ance  in  good  governance and therefore ensured that people in general were given ample oppo\\x00unities for pa\\x00icipating  in our initiatives and voicing their opinions. With this spirit, we have made an a\\x00empt to know 'Bharat Ke Man  Ki Baat' and taken this into account while de\\x00ning our work for the next \\x00ve years and in the formation of our  vision document.  We  connected  crores  of  people  under  the  'Bharat  Ke  Man  Ki  Baat'  dialogue  which  was  a  nationwide  campaign run by the BJP for a month. Millions of suggestions were shared with us through di\\x00erent means.  Our manifesto is a document of expression of crores of suggestions and aspirations. With the aid of about  7,700 suggestion boxes, 300 rath, more than 100 dialogue program, more than 4000 'Bharat Ke Man Ki  Baat' program and through the social media we have made an e\\x00o\\x00 to gauge  the ‘Mann ki Baat’ of people  across India. At the same time, we consulted many domain expe\\x00s, whose suggestions constitute the basis  of this vision document.  This vision document is the vision of an uninterrupted journey upon which we had embarked with the  blessings of the people in 2014. By presenting our achievements in the last \\x00ve years as a proof of our  dedication, we are \\x00rmly commi\\x00ed to continue that journey in the coming \\x00ve years. This vision document  is our plan of action for achieving these objectives and to ful\\x00l the aspirations of every Indian.  Since this document is inspired by the ‘will of the people’, we dedicate it to the people by reiterating our  unwavering commitment and dedication to  the creation of a New India.    Rajnath Singh Chairperson, Manifesto Commi\\x00ee  8  \\x0cTOWARDS A NEW INDIA As a continuing government, we will build on the foundations laid out in the last \\x00ve years in terms of re- establishing  macro-economic  stability,  building  long-term  frameworks  of  governance,  raising  India's  international stature, introducing a non-nonsense approach to internal/external security, upgrading the  stock of physical/social infrastructure and, most impo\\x00antly, building a basic safety net for the deprived  section  of  our  society. We  have  demonstrated  what  all  can  be  achieved  by  a  commi\\x00ed  and  decisive  leadership that is not afraid to take hard decisions.   In the next \\x00ve years, we promise to create growth oppo\\x00unities for all citizens in every aspect of life. Sab ka  Saath, Sab ka Vikas remains our guiding principle. We intend to reach out to a developed future while  retaining our civilisational roots.   In order to achieve our long-term goals, we must \\x00rst secure our country against internal and external  aggression. These threats need to be dealt with at their roots and our decisive leadership that will equip our  security apparatus with all the necessary tools. As we have already demonstrated, we intend to use our  foreign  policy,  were  necessary,  in  order  to  tackle  the  problem  of  global  terrorism. Thus,  we  intend  to  increase the strength of our diplomatic and allied cadres. We will also build on the “Make in India in Defence”  initiative to fu\\x00her indigenise our defense equipment.   Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised, in his very \\x00rst speech in Lok Sabha, that this government  would work for the welfare of the poorest. In the last \\x00ve years, we have created a transparent mechanism  for directly delivering basic services to the bo\\x00om of the pyramid by leveraging Aadhaar, DBT and Jan Dhan  accounts.  Basic  health  has  been  a  special  focus  with  large  investments  made  on  sanitation  (Swachh  Bharat), health insurance (Ayushmaan Bharat) and in modern medical facilities. We intend to accelerate the  pace  of  providing  access  to  basic  amenities  such  as  housing,  electricity,  toilet,  cooking  gas,  and  health/social security to every poor Indian household, rural and urban, in the next \\x00ve years and to bring the  percentage of population below the pove\\x00y line to single digits.   In  the  last  \\x00ve  years,  we  re-imposed  macro-economic  stability  while  building  lasting  frameworks  for  economic governance. These frameworks include the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code, in\\x00ation-targeting,  nationwide Goods & Services Tax, and the banking sector clean-up. These e\\x00o\\x00s have not only changed  the business culture of the country and anchored in\\x00ation at 4 percent, but have also been internationally  recognized with a sovereign rating upgrade and a sharp rise in our Ease of Doing Business ranking. We will  ensure that India remains the world's fastest growing major economy in future while maintaining macro- stability. We aspire to be the world's third largest economy by 2030.    Since our economic model is based on entrepreneurship and innovation, we commit to simplifying and  lowing tax rates. An impo\\x00ant aspect of the ease of doing business is the ability to enforce contracts and  resolve disputes. Therefore, we promise to signi\\x00cantly increase the capacity of the legal system within \\x00ve  years in pa\\x00nership/co-ordination with the judiciary.  The physical infrastructure of the country has undergone an unprecedented upgrade in the last \\x00ve years.  We have connected 91% of villages with rural roads, electri\\x00ed 100% of villages, operationalized 36 new  airpo\\x00s and introduced metro networks in several cities. Looking ahead, we plan to build 60,000 km of  National Highways, connect 100% of villages with rural roads, operationalize 100 new airpo\\x00s, modernize  400 railway stations, and cover 50 cities with metro networks.   9  \\x0cAgriculture employs a large propo\\x00ion of our labour force. In order to ensure remunerative prices for  farmers, the minimum suppo\\x00 price for 22 crops was increased to 1.5 times cost of production. In addition,  we have curbed the large-scale diversion of subsidized farm inputs through measures like Neem-coating  of urea, rolled out electronic National Agriculture Market (e-NAM),  provided insurance cover to 14 crore  farmers under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana and, most recently, introduced direct income suppo\\x00  for 12 crore farming families through the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi. In the next \\x00ve years, we will  create a National Warehousing Grid, invest Rs25 lakh crores in farm/rural productivity, introduce interest- free Kisan Credit Cards and extend the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi to all farmers. We remain  commi\\x00ed to the promise of doubling farmer incomes by 2022 and more resources will be made available if  necessary.   In the last \\x00ve years, we have created a national common market for the industry and services sectors. By  lowering in\\x00ation and cleaning up the banking system, we are now in a position to structurally lower the real  cost of capital. This is key to a sustained increase in private sector investment. We intend to establish a  National Traders' Welfare Board as well as announce a National Policy for Retail Trade. The tourism sector will  be  a  special  focus. We  will  make  sure  that  all  UNESCO World  Heritage Sites  in  India  have  facilities  of  international standard. We will also identify and promote speci\\x00c sites of cultural/natural impo\\x00ance as a  national priority (while being sensitive to their preservation).   The cultural, ecological and social capital of a country are just as impo\\x00ant as its economic capital. These  too  need  continuous  investment  and  we  intend  to  expand  suppo\\x00  for  protecting  cultural/linguistic  heritage, conserving sites of ecological/historical impo\\x00ance, and promoting our civilizational ideas both  internationally  and  to  the  next  generation. We  reiterate  our  stand  to  explore  all  possibilities  within  the  framework of the Constitution to facilitate the construction of a Ram Temple in Ayodhya.   We  remain  commi\\x00ed  to  ensuring  the  bene\\x00ts  of  constitutional  provisions  to  the  Scheduled  Castes,  Scheduled  Tribes  and  backward  classes.  We  recently  introduced  a  fu\\x00her  10%  reservation  for  the  economically backward sections of the non-reserved category. At the same time, we will expeditiously  complete the National Registration of Citizens in Assam and actively consider its extension to other states.   Every  society  progresses  through  the  empowerment  of  women,  inclusion  of  minorities  and  the  encouragement of youth. We will not allow these objectives to be held back by the politics of appeasement.  Therefore, we hope to modernize personal laws to prohibit practices such as Talaq-e-Biddat and Nikah  Halala. We intend to invest in our human potential by focusing on the quality of our primary/secondary  schools as well as expanding our te\\x00iary education capacity. In addition, we will also invest in a select set of  universities and research institutions in order make them world class.   For three generations, India's socio-economic system was held hostage to dynastic perpetuation. This  propagated a corrupt, self-servicing system of political patronage that came to pervade every aspect of  life in India. In 2014, the country voted decisively to end this system. Under the leadership of PM Modi, every  e\\x00o\\x00 has been made to re-establish probity in public life, introduce transparency in policy-making and in  the management of national assets as well as to bring o\\x00enders to book.   The  above  summary  is  based  on  the  vision  of  Prime  Minister  Modi  to  build  a  technologically  modern,  entrepreneurial,  rules-based  economy  that  is  secure  from  external/internal  security  threats  and  simultaneously able to build on its cultural, ecological and social assets.   10  \\x0cNation First  The decisive leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has fundamentally altered the national  security paradigm of India in the last \\x00ve years. Looking ahead, we propose to do the following:  Zero-Tolerance Approach to Terrorism   Our security doctrine will be guided by our national security interest only. This is exempli\\x00ed by the  Surgical Strikes and the Air Strikes carried out recently. We will \\x00rmly continue our policy of ‘Zero  Tolerance’ against terrorism and extremism and will continue to follow our policy of giving a free hand  to our security forces in combating terrorism.  National Security  Strengthening our Armed Forces - We will speed up the purchases of outstanding defense related  equipments  and  weapons.  In  order  to  equip  the  Armed  Forces  with  modern  equipment,  we  will  continue to take focused steps to strengthen the strike capability of the Armed Forces.  Self-reliance  in  defence  sector  -  In  order  to  ensure  self-reliance  in  procurement  of  defence  equipment, we have taken several e\\x00ective steps in the last \\x00ve years. For instance, the most modern  AK-203  automatic  ri\\x00es  are  being  manufactured  at Amethi  under  our  'Make  in  India  in  Defence'  initiative. We are commi\\x00ed to focus on 'Make in India in Defence' to enable indigenous production of  defence equipment. This will also generate employment and encourage investment in the defence  sector.  Welfare of Soldiers  We  have  already  demonstrated  our  commitment  to  the  welfare  of  our  veterans  with  the  implementation of long delayed OROP. To take this commitment forward, we promise to create a more  e\\x00ective framework for the rese\\x00lement of our Armed Forces veterans. Under this e\\x00o\\x00, the Armed  Forces will sta\\x00 planning for the rese\\x00lement of soldiers three years before their retirement and in  accordance with their preferences. This will include provision for skills training, so\\x00 skills training,  \\x00nancial suppo\\x00 for higher education, for housing and for sta\\x00ing an enterprise.  Modernization of Police Forces  We will continue to take forward the process of modernizing the Central Armed Police Forces to  fu\\x00her increase their capacity and readiness and enable them to e\\x00ectively combat internal security  challenges.  We  will  provide  assistance  to  the  states  to  upgrade  their  police  forces  through  the  ‘Scheme  for  Modernization of Police Forces’. We will encourage expedited police reforms in the states so as to  enable the State police forces to deal with new types of crimes like cyber crime and help them to be  more sensitive to the citizens, especially the weak and vulnerable sections of the society.  Combating In\\x00ltration  There  has  been  a  huge  change  in  the  cultural  and  linguistic  identity  of  some  areas  due  to  illegal  immigration,  resulting  in  an  adverse  impact  on  local  people's  livelihood  and  employment. We  will  expeditiously complete the National Register of Citizens process in these areas on priority. In future we  will implement the NRC in a phased manner in other pa\\x00s of the country.  We will continue to unde\\x00ake e\\x00ective steps to prevent illegal immigration in the No\\x00heastern states.  For this, we will fu\\x00her strengthen our border security. A pilot project on the use of technology to  strengthen border security (Sma\\x00 Fencing) was implemented in Dhubri (Assam). We will implement  this on all borders.  01  02  03  04  05  06  07  08  11  \\x0c09  10  11  12  13  Reinforcing Border Security  We will focus on creation of developmental and other necessary infrastructure in border areas to  ensure that border security is strengthened, and to enable increased pa\\x00icipation of and bene\\x00ts for  border areas in the country’s development and progress.  We have completed building six integrated check-posts with another under construction to facilitate  easier trade and travel from the neighboring countries. We will fu\\x00her ease the movement of goods  and people by constructing 14 more integrated check-posts by 2024. A\\x00er completion of all the  proposed integrated check-posts, all trade movement with Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan will be  conducted through the integrated check-posts.  Coastal Safety  A\\x00er e\\x00ectively strengthening coastal security through implementation of a coastal security scheme  to  provide  modern  equipment  and  allocating  funds  to  the  states  for  establishing  coastal  police  stations, establishment of National Commi\\x00ee for Strengthening Maritime & Coastal Security, Island  Information System  and  National Academy  of Coastal  Policing,  we  will  continue  to  take  steps for  ensuring security of India’s long coastline.  Citizenship Amendment Bill  We  are  commi\\x00ed  to  the  enactment  of  the  Citizenship  Amendment  Bill  for  the  protection  of  individuals of religious minority communities from neighbouring countries escaping persecution. We  will make all e\\x00o\\x00s to clarify the issues to the sections of population from the No\\x00heastern states who  have expressed apprehensions regarding the legislation. We reiterate our commitment to protect the  linguistic, cultural and social identity of the people of No\\x00heast. Hindus, Jains, Buddhists and Sikhs  escaping persecution from India’s neighbouring countries will be given citizenship in India.  Combating Le\\x00 Wing Extremism  We have already taken strong actions to reduce le\\x00 wing extremism to a very large extent and limited  them to small pockets. We are commi\\x00ed to taking necessary and e\\x00ective steps against le\\x00 wing  extremism to eliminate this menace in the next \\x00ve years. In the last \\x00ve years, we have focussed on  the development of economic and social infrastructure such as roads, mobile towers, schools and  medical facilities in the tribal areas a\\x00ected by le\\x00 wing extremism and we will continue to make  e\\x00o\\x00s in this direction.  Jammu & Kashmir- A\\x00icle 370  14  Ÿ  In the last \\x00ve years, we have made all necessary e\\x00o\\x00s to ensure peace in Jammu and Kashmir  through decisive actions and a \\x00rm policy. We are commi\\x00ed to overcome all obstacles that come  in the way of development and provide adequate \\x00nancial resources to all the regions of the state.  We reiterate our position since the time of the Jan Sangh to the abrogation of A\\x00icle 370.   Ÿ We  are  commi\\x00ed  to  annulling  A\\x00icle  35A  of  the  Constitution  of  India  as  the  provision  is  discriminatory against non-permanent residents and women of Jammu and Kashmir. We believe  that A\\x00icle 35A is an obstacle in the development of the state. We will take all steps to ensure a safe  and peaceful environment for all residents of the state. We will make all e\\x00o\\x00s to ensure the safe  return of Kashmiri Pandits and we will provide \\x00nancial assistance for the rese\\x00lement of refugees  from West Pakistan, Pakistan occupied Jammu and Kashmir (POJK) and Chhamb.  India suppo\\x00s peace,  but the country will not hesitate to take  any steps required for national security - Shri Narendra Modi  12  \\x0cDoubling Farmers’ Income   At the very beginning of our current term, Prime Minister Modi embarked on a mission to double  farmers’ income. We will make all e\\x00o\\x00s to achieve this goal by 2022.  Welfare of Farmers  01  02  03  04  05  06  07  Pradhan  Mantri  Kisan  Samman  Nidhi  Yojana  to  all  -  We  have  launched  Pradhan  Mantri  Kisan  Samman Nidhi Yojana to ensure \\x00nancial suppo\\x00 to farmers owning land up to 2 hectares. We will  fu\\x00her expand the coverage of the scheme to all the farmers in the country.  Pension for small and marginal farmers - We will launch a pension scheme for all small and marginal  farmers in the country so as to ensure social security to them on reaching 60 years of age.  ₹25 lakh crore investment in Agri-rural sector - We are commi\\x00ed to making an investment of Rs.  25 lakh crore to improve the productivity of the farm sector.  Interest-free Kisan Credit Card loans - We will provide sho\\x00-term new agriculture loans up to Rs. 1  lakh at a 0% interest rate for 1-5 years on the condition of prompt repayment of the principal amount.  Voluntary enrollment in Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana - Our scheme, Pradhan Mantri Fasal  Bima Yojana has ensured risk mitigation and provided insurance cover for all farmers. We will make  enrolment of farmers under the scheme voluntary.  Empowering Farmers through Policies - We will work towards reducing all agricultural impo\\x00s and  institute a predictable expo\\x00 and impo\\x00 policy with a built-in mechanism for encouraging expo\\x00s  and discouraging impo\\x00s.  Assurance  of Quality Seeds  - We  will  ensure  timely  availability  of  improved  seeds  of  promising  varieties at a\\x00ordable rates with doorstep testing facilities. Development of Argi-allied sectors  08 Oilseeds Mission - We will launch a new mission to achieve self-su\\x00ciency in oil seeds and other agri-  products.   Warehouse  Network  across  the  Country  -  We  will  build  an  e\\x00cient  storage  and  transpo\\x00  mechanism for agriculture produce  Ÿ Our Pradhan Mantri Krishi SAMPADA Yojana highlights our focus on warehousing as a means of  increasing farmers’ income. To fu\\x00her expand the warehousing infrastructure in the country, we  will establish a National Warehousing Grid along National Highways to ensure necessary logistical  linkages for warehousing of agricultural produce.  Ÿ To enable the farmer to store the agri-produce near his village and sell at a remunerative price at an  appropriate time, we will roll out a new Village Storage Scheme of agri-produce. We will provide  farmers with loans at cheaper rates on the basis of storage receipt of the agri-produce.  To ensure greater promotion and increase pro\\x00tability under organic farming, we will take the  following steps :  Ÿ We will promote chemical-free organic farming in an additional 20 lakh hectare of hilly, tribal and   rainfed areas in the next 5 years.  Ÿ We will launch a dedicated e-commerce po\\x00al to enhance the availability of organic produce to the   doorsteps of consumers.   13  09  10  \\x0cŸ Goshalas in the country will be linked to the promotion of organic farming.  Ÿ Promotion  of  organic  eco-tourism  in  the  vicinity  of  organic farming  will  also  ensure  additional   income to the farmers.   11 National Bee-keeping and Honey Mission: We will launch a National Bee-keeping and Honey   Mission to ensure additional returns to the farmers. We will double the honey production from the  present 11,500 MT by developing infrastructural facilities and providing marketing suppo\\x00.  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  Expanding Irrigation in Mission Mode  We  have  completed  work  on  the  long-pending  31  irrigation  projects  under  Pradhan  Mantri  Krishi  Sinchai  Yojana  and  work  will  soon  be  completed  on  the  remaining  68  projects  in  phases  up  to  December 2019. Continuing our e\\x00o\\x00s to developing irrigation, we will fu\\x00her expand Pradhan Mantri  Krishi Sinchai Yojana to realize 100% irrigation potential of the country within a de\\x00ned time-frame.  We will bring one crore hectares agricultural land under micro-irrigation, this would be supplemented  with ‘fe\\x00igation’ to promote judicious use of fe\\x00ilizers.  Cooperatives  We recognize the role of cooperatives and Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) can play in ensuring  be\\x00er market linkages and oppo\\x00unities in the agricultural sector and we are commi\\x00ed to suppo\\x00  and strengthen them.  We will enable the creation of 10,000 new Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) by 2022 to ensure  economies of scale for farmers regarding access to inputs and markets.  To cater to the needs of big cities we will set up a mechanism of direct marketing of vegetables, fruits,  dairy and \\x00shery products through farmers’ cooperative organizations so as to ensure be\\x00er price  return to the farmers.  Convergence of Agriculture and Technology  We  will  create  a  mobile  app  based  system  for  promoting  the  availability  of  agri-implements  on  rental/custom hiring basis.  We will extensively use technology to ensure a be\\x00er knowledge of the market prices of various agro- products for the bene\\x00t of farmers.  We  will  enable  development  of  young  agri-scientists  to  take  advantage  of  A\\x00i\\x00cial  Intelligence,  Machine Learning, Blockchain technology, Big Data analytics etc. for more predictive and pro\\x00table  precision agriculture.  We view solar energy as an additional source of income for farmers and will encourage solar farming  on a massive scale so as to enable the ‘Annadaata’(food provider) to become ‘Urja-daata’ (energy  provider).   Digitization of Land Records - On the lines of Aadhaar project, we will complete digitization of land  records  on  a  mission  mode.  We  will  implement  second-generation  land  reforms  to  ensure  title  guarantee  for  the  landholder  and  reduce  land-related  litigation.  We  will  create  a  model  law  for  conclusive titling (in consultation with states) promoting title guarantee and title insurance and work  with States to implement this system.   14  \\x0cAnimal Husbandry  22 We have given utmost impo\\x00ance to the dairy sector and have established Kamdhenu Aayog for the  conservation  of  indigenous  species  of  ca\\x00le.  We  will  establish  a  network  of  mobile  veterinary  dispensaries to provide doorstep service to farmers.  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  We  will  roll  out  a  model  programme for  periodic  health  checkup  of  all  ca\\x00le  and  other  domestic  animals at the district level with the help of veterinary expe\\x00s from the public and private sector.  We will expand the coverage of immunization and eliminate Foot and Mouth Disease and Brucellosis.  We will launch a National Feed and Fodder Mission to eliminate the sho\\x00age of fodder.  Fisheries - Blue Revolution  We will launch ‘Matsya Sampada Yojana’ with an allocation of Rs. 10,000 crores to ensure availability of  storage and marketing tools and infrastructure like ice-boxes, cold storages, ice-plants etc. for small  and traditional \\x00shermen.  We will promote aquaculture through easy access to credit.  We will facilitate farming of sea-weed, pearl as well as ornamental \\x00sh to ensure a be\\x00er return to the  \\x00shermen.  We will bring all \\x00shermen under the ambit of all welfare programmes and social security schemes  with expanded coverage for accident insurance.  15  \\x0cOn the Path of Gram Swaraj  Gram Swaraj is one of the principal pillars of Mahatma Gandhi’s vision of India. As we approach the  150th bi\\x00h anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, Bharatiya Janata Pa\\x00y resolves to realize his vision of  Gram Swaraj  by  ensuring  that  everyone  has  equitable  access  to  resources. As  India  reaches  the  de\\x00ning milestone of the 75th year of its independence in 2022, we pledge to adopt the ideals of Gram  Swaraj as envisaged by Mahatma Gandhi. In line with this vision we promise:  Saashray  (Housing)  We will ensure a pucca house to   every family who are either   living in a kuchha house or have  no access to housing by 2022.  Suchna se Sashaktikaran   (Digital connectivity  through Bharatnet)  We will ensure that every Gram  Panchayat is connected through   a high speed optical \\x00bre   network by 2022.   Sujal   (Drinking Water)  We will launch ‘Jal Jivan Mission’  under which we will introduce a  special program, ‘Nal se Jal’ to  ensure piped water connection   to every household by 2024.  Sadak se Samriddhi   (Road connectivity)  We will launch a massive ‘Rural  Road Upgradation Programme’   to connect centres of   education, healthcare centres,  and markets with hinterlands to   promote rural growth.  Swachhata se Sampannata   (Swachh Bharat Mission) We will ensure 100% disposal of  liquid waste water and reuse of   waste water.  16  \\x0cIndia as the World’s 3rd Largest Economy  Roadmap for 5 trillion dollar economy  01  02  India was branded as ‘fragile \\x00ve’ in 2014. Within \\x00ve years, we have turned India into a bright spot that  is not only the fastest growing major economy of the world but also enjoys macroeconomic stability.  We have already become the world’s sixth largest economy and will soon be among the top \\x00ve. We  aspire to make India the third largest economy of the world by 2030. This implies that we commit to  make India a US $ 5 trillion economy by 2025 and US $ 10 trillion economy by 2032.  When compared to all governments post-1991, this government has delivered the highest rate of  average GDP growth (7.3%) over the last \\x00ve years and maintained lowest rate of average consumer  in\\x00ation (4.6%). The consumer in\\x00ation is presently at 2.6%. This has been achieved with lower \\x00scal  de\\x00cits and signi\\x00cantly lower current account de\\x00cit as a percentage of GDP. Average \\x00scal de\\x00cit  as a percentage of GDP during 2014-19 has been brought down  to 3.7% from 5.4% during 2009-14.  Reduction in \\x00scal de\\x00cit of this order implies less burden of debt on future generations by almost  Rs.16 lakh crores. Average Current account de\\x00cit as a percentage of GDP during this government has  been reduced to 1.5% from 3.3% during 2009-14.    Tax Policy  03 Our  economic  policy  has  been  guided  by  the  principle  of  lowering  the  tax  rate  and  improving  compliance; thereby broadening of the tax base. With improved compliance and increased tax base,  the  tax  to GDP  ratio  has  reached  12%,  highest  in  the  recent  past,  up from  10.1%  in  2013-14. This  increased revenue has been deployed for bene\\x00ts to the poor and creation of infrastructure at an  unprecedented level. We will continue with our policy in the similar manner – lowering of tax rate  thereby rewarding honest tax payers and improving compliance.  Goods and Service Tax  04 Goods and Service Tax (GST) has resulted in overall lowering of tax rates and increased revenue  collection, pa\\x00icularly for States. When compared to base year of 2015-16, GST revenue for all states  have increased by 50% in three years. We will continue with the simpli\\x00cation of GST process by  engaging in dialogue with all stakeholders.   Promoting Yoga Globally  05 We will fu\\x00her continue our e\\x00o\\x00s to promote Yoga globally as the world celebrates 21st June as the  International Yoga  Day. We  will  promote Yoga  as  a  vital  method  to  achieve  physical  wellness  and  spiritual rejuvenation across the globe and will continue to work towards training of Yoga practitioners.  We will unde\\x00ake a rapid expansion of Yoga health hubs, Yoga tourism and research in Yoga.   ₹100 lakh crore Investment  06  While social security net for the poor and farmers will be expanded, we will take up capital investment  in the country to a new height. By 2024, we will make capital investment of Rs.100 lakh crore in the  infrastructure sector. We recognize that investment driven growth requires cheaper cost of capital. By  anchoring in\\x00ation at 4% and cleaning up our banking system we have created the space for structural  reduction in the cost of capital. This will not only help infrastructure investment but investment also in  the wider economy.  Thus, new India will be built on the basis of investment driven growth.  17  \\x0cMake In India   07  With  the  aim  of  developing  India  into  a  knowledge  based,  skill  suppo\\x00ed  and  technology  driven  society, we have launched the ‘Make in India’ campaign. A beginning has already been made through  our initiatives like Digital India, Sta\\x00up India and Skill India. To bring in fast and inclusive growth, we  have  also  carried  out  substantial  reforms  in  the  last few  years  in  terms  of  de-regulation  and  de- licensing,  with  an  aim  to  improve  ease  of  doing  business.  More  than  90%  FDI  approvals  are  now  through  the  automatic  route.    FDI  has  grown  by  almost  50%  in  the  last  \\x00ve  years.  Similarly,  implementation of One Nation, One Tax through GST has brought all businesses under single tax net.   08  Making India a global manufacturing hub - as we position India as a global manufacturing hub over  the next \\x00ve years, we will take the following steps:  Ÿ Top 50 Ranking in Ease of Doing Business Index- In the last four years, India has climbed 65 places  in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index. We will fu\\x00her work in this direction to take the  country’s ranking into the top 50.  Ÿ Strengthening Companies Act  -  In  order  to  incentivize  compliance  of  law  and  ease  of  doing  business, we will amend the Companies Act to impose civil liability for technical and procedural  defaults of a minor nature thus unclogging the majority of the cases from the cou\\x00s.  Ÿ New Industrial Policy - We will announce a new industrial policy to improve competitiveness of  manufacturing and services with an eye on Industry 4.0 in order to gear up for technologies like  a\\x00i\\x00cial intelligence and electric mobility. Special e\\x00o\\x00 will be made for MSMEs.  Ÿ Network  Approach  for  Growth  -  We  understand  that  clustering  and  network  e\\x00ects  are  impo\\x00ant in order to build competitiveness in cu\\x00ing edge industries. Therefore, we will invest in  creating  clusters/networks  that  can  take  on  the  world’s  best.  Public  procurement    and  government incentives will be used actively to build up these clusters and encourage job creation.   Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises   09  10  A special package was launched by the Government to boost the MSME sector. The Credit Guarantee  Scheme  of  the  Government  of  India  is  an  impo\\x00ant  component  wherein  loans  to  MSME  are  guaranteed.  Under this alone, the credit of around Rs.19,000 crore was achieved in 2017-18.  We would  aim to take this \\x00gure to Rs.1,00,000 crore by 2024.  Technology access and upgradation are key elements in the MSME sector.  Our government has taken  a major step in expanding  of ‘Technology Centres’ and we would achieve more than 150 such centres  all over the country by 2024.  These Technology Centres would help in mentoring skilling and proto- typing of MSMEs.  They will expose MSMEs to A\\x00i\\x00cial Intelligence, Robotics, Internet of Things, Vi\\x00ual  Reality, BlockChain technology and Zero Defect Zero E\\x00ect.  11  The Technology Centres, other skilling centres of MSMEs and NSICs incubation centres alone would  provide focussed and high level skilling to more than 6 lakh people per year.    12  Welfare of Small Traders -   Ÿ We will establish National Traders’ Welfare Board and create a National Policy for Retail Trade for   Ÿ To protect the interests of small traders, we will provide an accident insurance of 10 lakh rupees to   Ÿ On the lines of Kisan credit card, we will also create a scheme to give merchant credit card to   the growth of retail businesses.  all the traders registered under GST.   registered merchants.   18  \\x0cEntrepreneurship & Sta\\x00Ups  13  To  encourage  the  spirit  of  entrepreneurship  amongst  the  youth,  we  will  launch  a  new  scheme  to  provide collateral-free credit up to \\x0050 lakh for entrepreneurs. We will guarantee 50% of the loan  amount for female entrepreneurs and 25% of the loan amount for male entrepreneurs.  14  India  is  now  among  the  largest Sta\\x00up  ecosystems  of  the  world. We  will fu\\x00her  strengthen  this  ecosystem by:   Ÿ Easing regulatory requirement for sta\\x00-ups  Ÿ Targeting time spent for tax compliance at 1 hour per month  Ÿ Facilitating establishment of 50,000 new Sta\\x00ups in the nation by 2024   Ÿ Creating 100 Innovation Zones in Urban Local Bodies Ÿ Se\\x00ing up 500 new incubators and accelerators by 2024 Ÿ  Initiating ranking of Central Ministries, depa\\x00ments, State Governments and CPSUs for their  increased engagement with sta\\x00-ups and in bringing in innovation and newer technologies and  global practices and skills.   15  16   We will continue to promote and encourage Sta\\x00ups through creation of a ‘Seed Sta\\x00up Fund’ of  ₹20,000 crore.  We will suppo\\x00 entrepreneurial ventures sta\\x00ed by individuals from Scheduled Castes, Scheduled  Tribes, Other Backward Communities, or Economically Weaker Sections and take forward the ‘Stand- up India’ initiative.  17  We will set-up new 'Entrepreneurial No\\x00heast' scheme to provide \\x00nancial suppo\\x00 to the micro, small  and medium industries and for employment generation in the No\\x00heastern state.  Using Tourism to Cluster Services  18  19  20  Within the services sector, tourism will be special focus because it brings together many di\\x00erent  service segments.  In pa\\x00icular, we will identify speci\\x00c places of cultural or natural impo\\x00ance in order to develop them  as comprehensive destinations instead of leaving them as isolated sites. This requires that we look at  transpo\\x00 connection, heritage conservation, hotels, restaurants, ente\\x00ainment and other services in  an integrated way. We will make an e\\x00o\\x00 to ensure that all these services interconnect. Therefore, the  government will make sure that schemes/ agencies such as Swachh Bharat, ASI, forest depa\\x00ment  and local government work together with the travel and hospitality   industry. All UNESCO heritage  sites in India will be upgraded to international level facilities.  The  No\\x00h  eastern  states  and  our  Island/coastal  areas  will  be  developed  while  being  sensitive  to  conserving  their  ecological  uniqueness. Similarly,  places  of  cultural  impo\\x00ance  will  be  developed  while maintaining their unique heritage. As we have recently demonstrated by projects in Varanasi, an  e\\x00o\\x00 will be made to upgrade these sites while being sensitive to their historical/cultural heritage.  Transparent economy  21  We will continue our crackdown on Benami prope\\x00ies and illegal foreign bank accounts to bene\\x00t  honest  taxpayers  and  the  poor  of  the  country. We  will  also  expedite  our  actions  to  bring fugitive  economic o\\x00enders back to India and prosecute them for their crimes.  International Trade  22  We  will  ensure faster  customs  clearance  of  international  cargo  by  relaxing  clearance  procedures,  introducing  self-declaration  etc  and  adopting  new  scanning  technology.  We  will  also  provide  adequate \\x00nancial and institutional suppo\\x00 for expo\\x00ers and expo\\x00 organizations to build capacity  and equip them with adequate information to ensure unhindered expo\\x00s.  19  \\x0cInfrastructure   Foundation for New India  Infrastructure  is  the  backbone  of  any  economy.  In  the  10  years  of  UPA  rule,  policy  paralysis  and  corruption had derailed infrastructural development. The last \\x00ve years, under the leadership of  Prime  Minister Modi, infrastructural roll out has been put back on track. For the \\x00rst time, India has sta\\x00ed  marching and is being seen on the path of global standards in infrastructure and civic amenities. The  speed of constructing rural roads has doubled and 90% of rural road connectivity has been achieved.  Fu\\x00hermore, India has become a net expo\\x00er of electricity and has achieved maximum production of  coal  and  maximum  distribution  of  LED  bulbs. There  has  been  an  unprecedented  rise  in  the  po\\x00  capacity and the speed of se\\x00ing up new rail lines, gauge conversion, and electri\\x00cation of railway  tracks has doubled. We have invested at an unprecedented level in building infrastructure in the last  \\x00ve years.  This includes massive budgetary allocation for railways, highways, village roads and other  health as well as educational infrastructure. We have also sta\\x00ed and matured into a new technology  driven pla\\x00orm called PRAGATI (Pro-active Governance and Timely Implementation). Through this,  mechanism, we are de-bo\\x00lenecking major projects on a regular basis through video conference with  o\\x00cials across the country. Going forward,  01  02  We will aim at next generation infrastructure which will include gas grids and water grids, i-ways,  regional airpo\\x00s and way side amenities along National highways.  We will continue the fast pace with more and more public and private investment and e\\x00cient ground  level management on building of infrastructure fu\\x00her and to improve the quality of life and enhance  the ease of living.  03  In addition to ensuring e\\x00ciency in the economy this will also lead to creation of a large number of jobs  and livelihood oppo\\x00unities.  Ensuring Urban Development  04  Through the development of infrastructure and connectivity, we will ensure the fu\\x00her development  of suburban townships and new urban centres.  05  06  We will set up \\x00ve regional centres of excellence on urban issues. These centres will provide suppo\\x00 to  states and local bodies on issues of urban governance and growth.  Urban Mobility -We will launch a National Urban Mobility Mission to provide technology based urban  mobility  solutions  to  all  urban  local  bodies  and  increase  the  use  of  public  transpo\\x00,  enhance  walkability and cycle use. Under this mission, we will incentivize cities to integrate the public transpo\\x00  systems such as metro, local trains and local buses with the private service providers in the sector such  as, private bus operator, private taxi operator, the auto-rickshaw, e-rickshaw services, pedestrian and  cycling  infrastructure  for  a  seamless  and  smooth  last  mile  connectivity.  We  will  also  promote  a  common mobility card/ ticketing across di\\x00erent modes of transpo\\x00.  07  In the next \\x00ve years, we will ensure that 50 cities are covered with a strong metro network.   Swachh Bharat Mission  08  We have constructed over 9 crore toilets under our \\x00agship programme, Swachh Bharat Mission. We  will take the Mission to a new level through sustainable Solid Waste Management in every village.  Through the mission, we will ensure 100% disposal of liquid waste through emphasis on faecal sludge  management and reuse of waste water in rural, peri urban and unsewered areas.  09  We will ensure that all habitations a\\x00ain open defecation free status and those that have a\\x00ained the  status sustain the behavioural change.   20  \\x0cJal Shakti  Water is a critical resource but its management is spread across various depa\\x00ments, even at the  Central  level. We  will form  a  new  Ministry  of Water  unifying  the  water  management functions  to  approach the issue of water management holistically and ensure be\\x00er coordination of e\\x00o\\x00s. The  Ministry will expeditedly take forward the ambitious programme, conceptualized by Shri Atal Bihari  Vajpayee, for linking rivers from di\\x00erent pa\\x00s of the country and ensure a solution to the problems of  drinking water and irrigation. We will initiate work on this programme by constituting an authority.    We will launch ‘Jal Jivan Mission’ under which we will introduce a special programme, ‘Nal se Jal’ to  ensure piped water for every household by 2024.  We will ensure sustainability of water supply through special focus on conservation of rural water  bodies and ground water recharge.  Road Connectivity  In continuation to our existing milestone of constructing roads at an unprecedented pace, we will  construct 60,000 kms of National Highways in the next \\x00ve years.  We will double the length of National Highways by 2022.  We will complete the Phase-1 of Bharatmala Project expeditiously. We will also launch Bharatmala 2.0  project especially with a view to suppo\\x00 the states to develop state road networks connecting the  interior regions to the main roads and to e\\x00ectively leverage the economic potential and market  oppo\\x00unities of the concerned regions.  We will bring in new technologies and designs in road construction, operation and maintenance.  We want to become a world leader in e-mobility. \\x0010,000 crores have already been allocated to launch  a programme for promoting clean energy and ba\\x00ery operated vehicles. We will fu\\x00her work on this  front to ensure expansion of this new mobility experience.   Railways  We have made all e\\x00o\\x00s to make the experience of rail journey safe, smooth, clean and satisfying and  have achieved great results. We will continue the pace of work in this regard and encourage private  pa\\x00icipation in the development of railway amenities and infrastructure and provision of services.   We will ensure conversion of all viable rail tracks to broad gauge by 2022.  We will make all e\\x00o\\x00s to ensure electri\\x00cation of all railway tracks by 2022.  We will expand connectivity and experience of high speed trains and new version trains such as Vande  Bharat Express across the length and breadth of the country in the next \\x00ve years.  We will complete the dedicated freight corridor project by 2022.   We will launch a massive programme for modernization of railway stations in the country.  We will equip all main railway stations with Wi-Fi facility by 2022.  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  21  \\x0cEstablishment of New Airpo\\x00s  25  In 2014 there were 65 functional airpo\\x00s and there are a total of 101 functional airpo\\x00s today. In the  next \\x00ve years, we will double the number of functional airpo\\x00s.  Coastal Development  26  27  28  29  Potential of coastal development for transpo\\x00ation, tourism and for economic upli\\x00ment of coastal  communities has remained unexploited in the country. To exploit this potential fully, we have launched  the Sagarmala programme and will ensure speedy completion of the projects under this programme.  We will double our po\\x00 capacity in the next \\x00ve years.  We will fu\\x00her encourage integrated development of coastal areas including coastal cities, coastal  transpo\\x00 and coastal industrialization.   We will unde\\x00ake the upgradation of infrastructure for connecting the coast and hinterland to ensure  smooth transpo\\x00ation.   30  We will continue to focus on development of inland waterways for shi\\x00ing inland cargo movement  from road and rail to water transpo\\x00.  Energy  31  32  33  We  had  made  a  commitment  to  provide  24x7  electricity  to  all  and  the  country  has  substantially  a\\x00ained  the  goal.  All  remaining  villages  have  been  electri\\x00ed.  Similarly,  almost  all  remaining  households have been provided with an electricity connection. Thus, we are near completion of our  promise in a record time. We will fu\\x00her work towards completing any un\\x00nished task in this regard.   Exceptional  work  has  been  done  in  adding  to  the  electricity  generated  and  in  laying  down  of  transmission  lines  and  in  pu\\x00ing  up  the  nationwide  transmission  grid.  With  these  milestone  achievements, India can now claim that quantum of or access to electricity is no longer an issue. In fact,  India has also become a net expo\\x00er of electricity. Now, we will work towards: Ÿ Ensuring a right mix of energy which leads towards a cleaner environment Ÿ Supplying quality electricity to all consumers Ÿ Making the state electricity entities \\x00nancially sound and administratively more e\\x00cient.  India has become a global champion in addressing the issues of climate change through e\\x00ective and  feasible interventions. We have achieved cumulative installed renewable energy capacity of 76.87 GW  as on February, 2019 and are on track to achieve our goal of 175 GW by 2022. We will continue our  e\\x00o\\x00s in this regard and make it a popular movement. We will fu\\x00her make all e\\x00o\\x00s to invite other  countries of the world to become members of the International Solar Alliance.  Digital Connectivity  34  Every Gram Panchayat will be connected with high speed optical \\x00bre network by 2022. Through  village level high speed broadband services, we will provide a range of services such as telemedicine,  tele-education and agriculture related advisories.   22  \\x0cHealth for All  Prime Minister Sh. Narendra Modi took a historic step last year through the roll out of Ayushman Bharat  the  World’s  largest  healthcare  programme.  In  addition,  we  have  conceived  and  implemented  programmes for controlling prices of medicines, and signi\\x00cantly expanding Medical education. We  are commi\\x00ed to leverage all resources to ensure that the out-of-pocket expenditure on health is  reduced and all citizens can avail necessary medical services.  Making Healthcare Accessible   01  While providing annual health cover of Rs. 5 lakh to 10.74 crore poor families under the Pradhan Mantri  Jan Arogya Yojana under Ayushman Bharat, we also initiated a programme to set up 1,50,000 Health  and Wellness Centres (HWCs) by 2022.  Till date 17,150 HWCs have become functional.  We will take up  the programme of HWCs to next level.   We will target provisioning of telemedicine and diagnostic  laboratory facilities at these HWCs by 2022 to ensure quality primary medical care to the poor at his  doorstep.  02  We will create an essential devices list and a separate pricing policy for medical devices to ensure their  accessibility and a\\x00ordability to masses.   Strengthening Health Infrastructure  03  04  With our initiatives, we have successfully reached the stage of ensuring one Medical College for every  three Parliamentary Constituencies. We will take it forward and set up one Medical College or Post  Graduate Medical College in every district, through public or private pa\\x00icipation, by 2024.  To sta\\x00  with 75 such Medical Institutes will be set up by 2022.  This would ensure availability and accessibility  of quality secondary and te\\x00iary medical care to the citizens across the diverse landscape of our  country.    In a mere span of 5 years, we have increased the number of MBBS seats by 18,000 and that of Post- graduate  Medical  seats  by  12,000.   We  would fu\\x00her  accelerate  the  pace  of  reforms  in  medical  education sector so as to ensure transparency on one hand and improved doctor: population ratio on  the other hand.   With our e\\x00o\\x00s we will double the number of MBBS and Specialist doctors in the  country by 2024 as compared to the work done from 1947 till 2014.  Fu\\x00her, we will also accelerate the  reforms in para-medical education sector so as to increase the availability of nurses, pharmacists and  other paramedical personnel.  05  We will also accelerate the reforms in paramedical education sector so as to increase the availability of  nurses, pharmacists and other paramedical personnel.   Immunization and Nutrition   06  07  08  We  will  endeavour  to  make  the  National  Nutrition  Mission  a  mass  movement  and  strengthen  infrastructure and capacity in all Anganwadis.  The Mission Indradhanush programme has ensured full immunization of 3.39 crore children and 87.18  lakh pregnant mothers.  Fu\\x00her, the annual increase in the rate of immunization has jumped from 1%  per year to 6% per year. Continuing this pace, we will ensure full immunization coverage for all the  children and pregnant women by 2022.   Eliminating Tuberculosis  Tuberculosis claims more lives every year than any other infectious disease.  As on today, more than 25  lakh citizens are su\\x00ering from TB while over 3 lakh persons die due to TB every year.   The disease  mainly a\\x00ects the poor and malnourished.  We have rolled out a Special Mission to eliminate TB from  India by 2025.  We will ensure this becomes a success much ahead of the target given in Sustainable  Development Goals (SDGs)  23  \\x0cGood Governance  Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has always maintained that Good Governance is the cornerstone of  good politics. In the last \\x00ve years, we have put in place a framework of governance which will yield rich  dividends over the next generation.  Simultaneous Elections   We are commi\\x00ed to the idea of simultaneous elections for Parliament, State assemblies and local  bodies  to  reduce  expenditure,  ensure  e\\x00cient  utilisation  of  government  resources  and  security  forces and for e\\x00ective policy planning. We will try to build consensus on this issue with all pa\\x00ies.  Single Voter List - In order to ensure that every citizen gets the right to exercise his/her franchise for all  public bodies and to avoid confusion created by multiple voter lists, we will strive to ensure a common  voter list for all elections.   Corruption-free Bharat  In order to curb corruption, the Modi government has taken many e\\x00ective steps such as enacting the  Fugitive Economic O\\x00enders Act,2018, Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act,2018,   and   the  Benami Transaction Prohibition (Amendment) Act, 2016. We have eliminated ine\\x00ia in the government  by ensuring decisive actions under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi and will continue to make  e\\x00o\\x00s to ensure more e\\x00ective governance and transparent decision making.  01  02  03  Civil Service and Governance Reforms  04  To transform India into a developed nation, we need to work with the guiding principle of “Minimum  Government and Maximum Governance” and we will bring reform in the Civil Services and implement  it  in  a  manner  to  achieve  the  same.  In  order  to  ensure  be\\x00er  implementation  of  policies  and  coordination, we will merge similar and complementary depa\\x00ments into sectoral ministries. This will  allow policymakers to frame holistic and comprehensive policies on the one hand and ensure smooth  implementation on the other.  05  We will continue to implement the Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan in a focussed manner to build the  capacity of members of Panchayati Raj Institutions and ensure e\\x00ective delivery of schemes at the  grassroots.   Police reforms   06  Police  is  the  most  basic  and  key functionary  a\\x00ecting  the  people’s  life. An  e\\x00ective  policing  and  peaceful law and order is the key to growth and development. Our present police and policing is based  upon the colonial police force and there is a need to change and transform the police according to the  challenges of the 21st century. Therefore, we will bring Police Reform. We will formulate a ‘Model Police  Act’ in consultation with the States to have a pro-people citizen friendly police. This will take the Indian  policing at par with its contemporaries anywhere in the world.  Judicial Reforms  07  We will work towards simplifying procedural laws, encouraging mediation and strengthening judicial  and cou\\x00 management system in order to increase accessibility.   24  \\x0c08  Making India the centre of arbitration - We will increase the number of Alternative Dispute Resolution  forums to ensure avenues for quick disposal of ma\\x00ers. We will also take all necessary steps to make  India a hub of arbitration services.  International Financial Services Centre Authority  09  In order to establish India as a hub of \\x00nancial services, we will expedite the enactment of legislation  for  creating  an  International  Financial  Services  Centre  Authority  which  will  put  in  place  a  robust  regulatory framework. We will continue and fu\\x00her increase the ongoing incentives to expand digital  transactions.  Implementing Cooperative Federalism E\\x00ectively  10  We have set an example of inclusive federal governance through steps such as the creation of NITI  Aayog, establishment of the GST council and restructuring of central schemes in line with our pledge  of cooperative federalism. We will continue to pursue this course by ensuring greater involvement of  the states in all aspects of policy making and governance thereby strengthening federalism. We will  also ensure implementation of the 14th Finance Commission’s recommendations.  Ease of Living  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  We will set up a commi\\x00ee for Easing Citizens’ Interactions with Government (CECIG) to work with  expe\\x00s in reforming citizen’s inte\\x00ace with Government across domains such as taxes, business  compliance, rules and regulations for greater simplicity and ease.  To empower citizens and ensure time-bound delivery of public services, we will explore every avenue  to implement the Right to Service.   Science and Technology  The future belongs to Science and Technology and the use of technology for development of people.  We  will  launch  a  new  Science  Mission  for  development  of  cu\\x00ing  edge  technologies  and  future  technologies with two submissions, speci\\x00cally focused on (a) a\\x00i\\x00cial intelligence mission and (b)  robotic research mission with the aim to leapfrog into the future world of cu\\x00ing edge technologies.    Our \\x00rst agenda is our people. Today much of our S&T investment is in central institutions. We will aim  to spread this to the 95% of students who a\\x00end state government institutions also. This will be done  by  investment from  the  government  through  a  National  Research  Foundation  in  pa\\x00nership  with  States. Industry investment in R&D will also be enhanced, in pa\\x00nership with our network of national  laboratories.   We  will  launch  a  Language Translation  Mission  that  will  enable  ready  translation  of  English  text  in  Science & Technology and humanities in any of our languages. This will take the best works, bilingually,  to every student in the country.    We will initiate a genome mission for human health that will bring the latest diagnosis and treatment to  our entire population through frugal innovation.    We will explore the diversity of our oceans, have a human crewed submersible going to the deepest  oceans that will facilitate sustainable use of resources. With a thrust on non-fossil fuels, our research  mission in this area will reduce impo\\x00s and make India a leader in new technologies.   The supercomputer, A\\x00i\\x00cial Intelligence and Quantum Missions will make India not only Industry 5.0  ready but also a leader. The Swachh Bharat mission has transformed one side of Swachhata. Now we  will get the latest technologies to transform Waste to Energy and Wealth in a major mission. We will also  strive towards semiconductor manufacturing within the country.  25  \\x0c19  A\\x00er achieving unprecedented success through Mission Shakti, we are commi\\x00ed to ensuring that  'Gaganyaan' successfully demonstrates our scienti\\x00c capabilities of executing a manned mission in  space. We will sta\\x00 the 'National Program for Rapid Research in Socially Contextual Technologies' to  create  research  paths  in  desirable  technologies  and  to  manage  \\x00nancing  of  such  projects  in  coordination with the private sector.  Forest and Environment  20  21  22  We have ensured speed and e\\x00ectiveness in issuing forest and environmental clearances for eligible  projects due to which we have added around 9000 Sq. Kms to the forest cover of the country. We are  commi\\x00ed  to  maintaining  this  pace  through  adoption  of  cleaner  practises  to  make  our  nation  a  greener country.   We have evolved technologically be\\x00er strategies and devices to map the level of pollution in cities  and rivers and have taken e\\x00ective steps to reduce the level of pollution in major cities, including the  national capital. We will conve\\x00 the National Clean Air Plan into a Mission and we will focus on 102 most  polluted cities in the country. Through conce\\x00ed action, we will reduce the level of pollution in each of  the mission cities by at least 35% over the next \\x00ve years.   We have continuously protected and promoted the interest of forest dwellers pa\\x00icularly the tribal  communities. We have endeavoured to provide basic amenities, such as roads, telephone connectivity  and  cooking  gas  connection  in  addition  to  houses  and  toilets,  at  the  doorstep  of  people  living  in  remotest forest areas. We are commi\\x00ed to continuing our work in this direction.  Protecting the Himalayas  23  We will ensure the Himalayan States are provided special \\x00nancial assistance in the form of a 'Green  Bonus' to facilitate the protection and promotion of forests in those states.  Focussing on Island Territories  24  25  We have taken impo\\x00ant steps such as establishing the Island Development Authority to ensure the  overall  development  of  the  island  regions.  We  will  continue  to  focus  on  these  areas  given  their  economic potential and strategic impo\\x00ance.  We will preserve the unique identity of Andaman-Nicobar and Lakshadweep Islands and build a world- class  infrastructure  compatible  with  the  local  ecosystem.  We  will  focus  on  fully  developing  the  potential of tourism in these islands to bring transformational improvement in the standard of living  and income of the residents.  Focussing on Union Territories  26  We will develop Union Territories as models of development and good governance, and ensure the  highest quality of living, citizen services and infrastructure for the residents of Union Territories.  Development of No\\x00heastern States  27  28  We have ensured that the insurgency in the No\\x00heastern States is brought under control and the  security  situation  in  these  states  improved  signi\\x00cantly. We  will  leverage  this  situation  to  ensure  accelerated development of the No\\x00heastern states.  We will continue to focus on the development of infrastructure and improved connectivity in this  region  to  ensure  that  the  No\\x00heastern  states  duly  pa\\x00icipate  in  the  economic  progress  of  the  country. We will continue to take the necessary steps to leverage the tremendous potential of hydro- electric, tourism, ho\\x00iculture etc in the No\\x00heastern states.  29  We are commi\\x00ed to ensure that the unique linguistic, cultural and social identity of the No\\x00heastern  States is adequately protected and take steps to ensure the same.  26  \\x0cYuva Bharat - Tomorrow’s India  We need to create stepping stones for the next-generation in order to ensure that they can pa\\x00icipate  more fully in building New India.   Creating Oppo\\x00unities for Youth   01  We  will  create  new  oppo\\x00unities  of  employment  by  providing  more  suppo\\x00  to  the  22  major  'Champion Sectors' identi\\x00ed as the main drivers of Indian economy. We will optimally leverage the  untapped employment-generation of potential of sectors such as defence and pharmaceuticals to  take advantage of the oppo\\x00unities available in domestic and foreign markets.  02  Entrepreneurship & Sta\\x00Ups- To encourage the spirit of entrepreneurship amongst the youth, we  will take the following steps :   Ÿ We will launch a new scheme to provide collateral-free credit up to ₹50 lakh for entrepreneurs. We  will guarantee 50% of the loan amount for female entrepreneurs and 25% of the loan amount for  male entrepreneurs.  Ÿ We will set-up new 'Entrepreneurial No\\x00heast' scheme to provide \\x00nancial suppo\\x00 to the micro,   small and medium industries and for employment generation in the No\\x00heastern state.   Ÿ More than 17 crore entrepreneurs have availed loans under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana. We   will expand this initiative fu\\x00her to take the number of bene\\x00ciaries of Mudra loans up to 30 crore.  Ÿ We will continue to promote and encourage Sta\\x00ups through creation of a ‘Seed Sta\\x00up Fund’ of   ₹20,000 crore.  Youth In Governance   03  Engaging Youth with Society - To ensure increased pa\\x00icipation of youth in our society, we will take  the following steps :   Ÿ We will incentivise and reward self-organized groups of youth who adopt social assets like schools,  hospitals, lakes, public gardens etc. and ensure their maintenance and cleanliness to encourage  greater civic engagement of the youth.  Ÿ We will launch a special awareness and treatment programme for de-addiction among youth to   protect them from the harmful e\\x00ects of substance abuse and addiction    04  Youth in Urban Governance - We will suppo\\x00 a large scale internship programme for the youth in  urban local bodies, matching skills needed by the local bodies and providing the young with much  needed understanding of urban issues.  Spo\\x00s  05  06  We  will  map  state  and  district-wise  spo\\x00  talent  and  strengths,  recognize  the  traditional  spo\\x00ing  practices and focus on the promotion of speci\\x00c spo\\x00s in speci\\x00c regions.  Our  government  has  taken  comprehensive  steps  to  develop  the  culture  of  spo\\x00s  in  the  country  through the 'Khelo India' scheme, and we will continue to provide adequate resources under this  scheme to ensure the achievement of declared objectives. Under this scheme, special a\\x00ention will be  given to encourage spo\\x00ing talent among women and tribals.  27  \\x0c07  08  09  In order to fu\\x00her promote spo\\x00s, we will introduce practical spo\\x00s courses as pa\\x00 of the educational  curriculum  and  also  establish  a  National  Spo\\x00s  Education  Board  for  the  development  of  spo\\x00spersons.  We will suppo\\x00 the creation of a mini-stadium in each sub-district, with the pa\\x00icipation of state  governments, to encourage spo\\x00s and to make spo\\x00ing infrastructure available in the rural areas.   We will formulate a mechanism to ensure that the capacity of existing spo\\x00ing infrastructure is easily  accessible  for  use  of  spo\\x00spersons  and  new  models  including  PPP  will  be  explored  to  ensure  maintenance and management of such assets.  10  We will promote the Fit India campaign as an integral pa\\x00 of building a culture of spo\\x00s in India and will  consistently unde\\x00ake necessary steps to encourage broader awareness and pa\\x00icipation in the  campaign.  India is a youthful country.  A country with such a major percentage of youth has the  capability to change not only  its own, but the fate of the entire world.  - Shri Narendra Modi  28  \\x0cEducation for All  While  keeping  the  education  system  in  pace  with  modern  trends  and  knowledge,  our  e\\x00o\\x00s  will  continue to be oriented towards ensuring a global, scienti\\x00c, outcome-focused, knowledge-oriented,  accessible,  inclusive  and  student-friendly  education  system  in  order  to  ensure  that  students  can  optimally bene\\x00t from the education system.  Primary and Secondary Education  Having  achieved  access  and  equity  in  school  education,  our  emphasis  will  now  be  on  quality  of  learning. We have already identi\\x00ed learning outcomes for various classes and our priority in the next  \\x00ve years will be to ensure that children achieve these learning outcomes. We will focus on teachers  training and capacity building as a key factor in achieving these learning outcomes.  We consider it our duty to provide a conducive environment for talented children in our country to  facilitate them to unleash their talent. For this, we will initiate a ‘Prime Minister Innovative Learning  Program’ to bring together such children for a ce\\x00ain period in a year in one place from all over the  country and provide them with facilities and resources for them to excel. This would instill a culture of  lateral thinking and innovation among them.   We will establish National Institutes of Teachers’ training. These institutions would provide four-year  integrated  courses  that  would  set  the  standards  for  quality  teachers  in  our  schools. We  will  also  motivate States to replicate this model as it is our \\x00rm belief that quality teachers lay the foundation of  quality learning.  We are commi\\x00ed to using technology in classrooms and in impa\\x00ing education. We will move ahead  to provide sma\\x00 classes to our children in schools. To begin with, we will initiate this process in the  secondary classrooms.    Kendriya  Vidayalalas  and  Navodaya  Vidayalas  have  done  yeoman  service  in  the  \\x00eld  of  school  education. In order to cater to the demands of more such schools, we aim to open another 200 such  schools by 2024.   Higher Education   We will take all necessary steps to increase the number of seats in Central Law, Engineering, Science  and Management institutions by at least 50% in the next \\x00ve years. We will also motivate States to  accordingly increase the number of seats in State institutions.  We have given due emphasis to on-line courses as a medium of delivering education in the last \\x00ve  years.  We will take it to the next level and make it a major resource for impa\\x00ing higher education.   While  we  have  world-class  Technology,  Science  and  Medical  institutions,  the  same  needs  to  be  replicated in other areas. We will set up an A\\x00s, Culture and Music University with a focus on \\x00ne a\\x00s  such as music and dance. We will also open a state-of-the-a\\x00 Hospitality and Tourism University and a  Police University. States will be encouraged to establish similar institutions of excellence.  We  will  relook  the  role  of  existing  regulatory  institutions’  and  make  necessary  changes  in  the  legislation to ensure a regulatory overhaul. We will formulate new regulatory mechanism to provide  autonomy to quality institutions and focus towards se\\x00ing national standards. It will work towards  promoting  excellence  and  quality  learning  in  higher  education  while  providing  academic  and  functional autonomy to institutions.  01  02  03  04  05  06  07  08  09  29  \\x0c10  11  12  13  14  In the past \\x00ve years, our emphasis has been on quality higher educational institutions and Institutions  of Eminence have been a step in that direction. We will take it forward in the next \\x00ve years and create  50 such institutions by 2024.  In the past 5 years, a number of our institutions have \\x00gured in the top 500 institutions of the world. We  will encourage academic institutions towards excellence and motivate more such institutions to rank  among the top 500 institutions of the world.  We will consciously promote a programme for ‘Study in India’, which will focus on bringing foreign  students to study in higher educational institutions in our country and make India a major destination  for education for foreign students.  To ensure innovation and quality research, we will incentivise the industry to collaborate with our  scienti\\x00c labs and technological institutions, to unde\\x00ake research in cu\\x00ing-edge technology and  science.  We have launched the ‘National Digital Library of India’ and provided access to e-books and many  other papers to the students free-of-cost. To fu\\x00her promote a research-orientation in our higher  education institutions, we will take it forward by providing access to leading journals free of cost to the  students.   Skill Development  15  We will formulate a ‘National Policy for Reskilling and Upskilling’ to evolve a \\x00exible and industry- responsive  workforce  which  is  capable  of  accessing  new  oppo\\x00unities  and  to  insulate  it  from  technological shocks.  30  \\x0cWomen Empowerment  As, The Prime Minister has stated that ‘India needs not just women development, but women-led  development that makes women the leading force of our development trajectory’, and as per this  belief, we have determinedly gone beyond tokenism to take substantive measures to ensure overall  development of women and achieve gender equality. Building on these positive measures we will  continue  to  pursue  the  course  of  holistic  development  and  increased  pa\\x00icipation  of  women  in  society and economy.  Women-led Development  The gains made under our pioneering ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’ programme have been impressive.  We are commi\\x00ed to continue to build on these gains to provide accessible and a\\x00ordable quality  education to all women. We will ensure that ample \\x00nancial suppo\\x00 is available to girls through out  their education and subsidised education loans are provided for higher education.   During the last \\x00ve years, we have focussed on ensuring a safe and digni\\x00ed life and access to basic  resources for women through various schemes such as Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Ujjwala, Pradhan  Mantri Awas Yojana, Saubhagya. In the next 5 years, to ensure \\x00nancial empowerment among women  in rural and semi-rural areas and create be\\x00er employment oppo\\x00unities for them, we will make every  e\\x00o\\x00  to  ensure  access  to  credit  and  other  resources,  capacity  building,  market  and  distribution  network for women entrepreneurs, SHGs and women farmers.  We are commi\\x00ed to make women equal pa\\x00ners in and equal bene\\x00ciaries of the progress and  prosperity of the nation and will formulate a comprehensive ‘Women in Workforce’ roadmap focussed  on dramatically increasing the female workforce pa\\x00icipation rate over the next \\x00ve years. We will also  encourage industries and corporates to generate be\\x00er employment oppo\\x00unities for women.   To  generate  be\\x00er  work  oppo\\x00unities  for  women,  10%  material  to  be  sourced  for  government  procurement will be done from MSMEs having at least 50% women employees in their workforce.This  will cover various impo\\x00 substitution items including, but not limited to, apparel, leather, paper and  wood, a\\x00icles, stone items like idols, etc, plastic and rubber items, furniture, clocks, toys etc.   To ensure greater pa\\x00icipation of women in the workforce, it is necessary to enable them to continue  in the workforce by providing suppo\\x00 for child care. Our government has already made it mandatory  for  any  establishment  with  50  or  more  employees  to  have  the  facility  of  a  creche.   We  will  now  strengthen  the  creche  programme  with  special  focus  on  the  needs  of  parents  employed  in  the  unorganized sector to provide crèche and child care facilities by leveraging the existing Anganwadis,  civil society organisations and the private sector. We will ensure that the number of childcare facilities  is increased three fold by 2022.  Ensuring Equal Rights  We have determinedly taken substantive measures to ensure overall development of women and  promote gender equality. Continuing our work, we will legislate a bill to prohibit and eliminate practices  such as Triple Talaq and Nikah Halala.  Ensuring a Digni\\x00ed Life for Women  Continuing our e\\x00o\\x00s to ensure safe motherhood through schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Matru  Vandana Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Matritva Suraksha Abhiyaan and Ayushman Bharat, we will focus on  ensuring good quality, easily accessible and a\\x00ordable maternal healthcare services for all women.  The government has launched a major initiative on malnutrition by launching the POSHAN Abhiyan.  We  will  reduce  the  malnutrition  level  by  at  least  10%  in  the  next  \\x00ve  years,  doubling  the  rate  of  reduction of malnourishment.  01  02  03  04  05  06  07  08  31  \\x0c09  10  11  12  13  14  We will ensure that all reproductive and menstrual health services are easily available to all women  across India and with the expansion of ongoing Suvidha scheme, sanitary pads at an a\\x00ordable cost of  just Rs. 1 will be provided to all women and girls.  We  have  very  signi\\x00cantly  increased  the  honararium  of  ASHA  and  Anganwadi  workers.  We  will  increase the coverage of Ayushman Bharat to include all Anganwadi workers and ASHA workers to  ensure improved health and social suppo\\x00 system for these frontline workers.   Women's security will be given more priority. We have constituted the Women's Security Division in the  Home Ministry, and have made strict provisions for transferring the laws in order to commit crimes  against women, in pa\\x00icular in a time-bound investigation and trail for rape. In such cases, forensic  facilities and fast track cou\\x00s will be expanded to bring convicts to justice.  To create a positive atmosphere for women, promote gender justice and create awareness on issues  related  to  women,  gender  sensitisation  courses  will  be  made  an  essential  pa\\x00  of  all  educational  institution’s curriculum and training modules of public o\\x00ces.  We are commi\\x00ed to ensure the welfare of widows of defence personnel who were killed in action. We  will formulate a dedicated programme for the creation of work oppo\\x00unities, provide skill training and  strengthen social security mechanism for widows of our Ma\\x00yrs.   Reservation for Women  Women's welfare and development will be accorded a high priority at all levels within the government,  and  the  BJP  is  commi\\x00ed  to  33%  reservation  in  parliament  and  state  assemblies  through  a  constitutional amendment.  A\\x00er all, our dream  of 'New India' is the  one where women  are strong and  empowered and  are equal pa\\x00ners  in the development  of the country.  - Shri Narendra Modi  32  \\x0cInclusive Development  The creation of an open and egalitarian society is central to the philosophy of the BJP. ‘Sabka Saath,  Sabka Vikas’ is at the hea\\x00 of PM Modi’s vision of New India.   Ensuring Justice for All  01  02  03  04  05  We are commi\\x00ed to ensure  bene\\x00ts of constitutional provisions of the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled  Tribes and backward classes. We will ensure that proper representation and oppo\\x00unities are available  for these sections.  We have decisively ensured that the economically weaker sections (EWS) of the society who belong to  the  non-reserved  category  are  represented  and  have  access  to  government  jobs  and  higher  education through the 10% EWS reservation which was long overdue. We will implement the law in the  same spirit while ensuring that SCs, STs and OBCs continue to have their fair representation.  Strengthening ‘Sabka Vikas’  To ensure that quality education is available and easily accessible, every block with more than 50% ST  population and at least 20,000 tribal persons will have an Eklavya Model Residential School. Eklavya  Schools will be at par with Navodaya Vidyalayas and besides providing state of the a\\x00 training in spo\\x00s  and skill development, these schools will have special facilities for preserving local a\\x00 and culture.    Continuing our e\\x00o\\x00s to promote social and political empowerment, we will ensure that the rights of  all forest dwellers are fully protected.  We will establish 50,000 ‘Van Dhan Vikas Kendras’ in the tribal areas of the country to ensure the  availability of primary processing and value addition for forest produce and to provide employment for  tribals and increase tribal income.  06  We  will  make  adequate  provisions for  personal  safety  equipment  and  accelerate  the  adoption  of  mechanized cleaning to ensure occupational health and safety for Safai Karamcharis.  Ensuring welfare of Poor  07  08  09  10  We are commi\\x00ed to bringing down the percentage of families living below the pove\\x00y line to a single  digit in the next \\x00ve years.   We will ensure pucca houses for families either living in kuchha houses or without access to housing by  2022.   We have been successful in extending the food security cover to over 80 crore people from poor and  lower-middle-income families  who  are  receiving food  grains  (wheat/rice/coarse  grains)  at  highly  subsidized prices.  We will fu\\x00her widen this cover to provide subsidized sugar (at Rs. 13 per kg per  family per month) to these 80 crore families in line with our mo\\x00o ‘Sabka Saath-Sabka Vikas’.  The unprecedented success of the Jan Dhan Yojana has dramatically improved \\x00nancial inclusion in  India. We will take fu\\x00her steps to ensure access to bank branches, payment banks and banking  correspondents by creating a new data-sharing framework that builds on the success of Jan Dhan and  Aadhaar pla\\x00orms while ensuring data privacy and security. With this scheme, we will ensure that  every Indian has access to banking facilities within a radius of 5 km. We will also launch a technology- enabled  programme  for  broader  \\x00nancial  literacy  by  complementing  \\x00nancial  literacy  with  mass  media  campaigns  to  provide  information  on  \\x00nancial  products  and  their  use  to  enable  e\\x00ective  pa\\x00icipation of every Indian in the \\x00nancial system.  33  \\x0cResponsive to the Needs of Aspirational Middle Class  11  A\\x00er providing major tax relief in the recent budget, we are commi\\x00ed to fu\\x00her revise the tax slabs  and the tax bene\\x00ts to ensure more cash and greater purchasing power in the hands of our middle- income families.  12  We  will  make  all  e\\x00o\\x00s  to  ensure  that  our  aspirational  middle  class  has  access  to  education,  employment oppo\\x00unities and suitable urban infrastructure for a be\\x00er quality life.   Commitment to Geographical Equity  13  Inclusive development also means inclusion by geography. To this end, our Government has identi\\x00ed  115 aspirational districts that are being given special a\\x00ention. We intend to continue with this e\\x00o\\x00 to  ensure that these districts catch up with the rest of the country. Similarly, we have already laid the  foundation  for  economic  and  social  progress  of  Eastern  India  through  improved  connectivity,  construction of high impact infrastructure projects and provision of adequate \\x00nancial resources. We  intend to continue our e\\x00o\\x00s to resolve the geographical imbalance of the said region and ensure that  Eastern India is an equal pa\\x00icipant in the progress and growth of the nation.  In PM Modi’s words, this  is ‘Purvoday’ (Rise of the East).  Development with Dignity for the Minorities  14  We are commi\\x00ed to the empowerment and ‘development with dignity’ of all minorities (Muslims,  Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains and Parsis etc ).  Caring for the Elderly  15  We will strengthen the Rashtriya Vayoshri Yojana to ensure that poor senior citizens in need of aids and  assistive devices receive them in a timely manner.  Enabling Divyangs  16  17  18  To take forward the gains achieved under Sugamya Bharat, we will put in place a system of continuous  accessibility audits and ratings for cities, public infrastructure including airpo\\x00s, railway stations and  public transpo\\x00 systems, to ensure that they are fully accessible, with collaboration with industry and  civil society organisations.  We will prioritize Divyang bene\\x00ciaries under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and mandate accessibility  benchmarks to be met in Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana.   Anganwadi  and  pre-school  system  will  be  strengthened  to  ensure  that  cases  of  disabilities  are  detected at an early stage.  19  We will o\\x00er higher interest rates on \\x00xed deposits by divyangs.  Political resolution on the ma\\x00er of Gorkha  20  We will recognise the 11 le\\x00 out Indian Gorkha sub-tribes as Schedule Tribes. We are also commi\\x00ed to  implement the reservation in the legislative assembly of Sikkim for Limboo and Tamang tribes.  21  We are commi\\x00ed to work towards \\x00nding a permanent political solution to the issue of Darjeeling  Hills, Siliguri Terai and Dooars region.   34  \\x0cEnsuring welfare of the Labour Force  22  Under our government, there has been a 42% growth in the National Minimum Wage. We will maintain  the same direction over the next \\x00ve years to ensure a respectable living for the workers.   Pension Scheme for all Small Shopkeepers  23  We will expand the Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maandhan scheme to cover all small shopkeepers.   Ensuring Welfare of A\\x00isans  24  We will create an umbrella scheme ‘Pradhan Mantri Kalanidhi Yojana’ to allow \\x00exible and customized  packages of credit, working capital and social security options to provide comprehensive suppo\\x00 to  traditional a\\x00s.  Protecting Our Children  25  We  will  formulate  a  comprehensive  Child  Protection  Framework  to  facilitate  the  se\\x00ing  up  of  standards and robust inspection and monitoring of child care institutions across India.  Empowering Transgenders  26  27  We are commi\\x00ed to bring transgenders to the mainstream through adequate socio-economic and  policy initiatives.   We will ensure self-employment and skill development avenues for transgender youth.   35  \\x0cCultural Heritage  Since inception, the philosophy of the BJP is anchored in the civilisational ethos of India. As we build  ‘New India’, we intend to actively invest in strengthening our cultural roots and preserving civilisational  continuity.  Far  from  seeing  our  cultural  values  as  hurdles  to  progress,  we  see  them  as  essential  ingredients of our future.  Ram Mandir  01  We reiterate our stand on Ram Mandir. We will explore all possibilities within the framework of the  Constitution and all necessary e\\x00o\\x00s to facilitate the expeditious construction of the Ram Temple in  Ayodhya. Conserving Bharatiya Faith and Culture  02 We are commi\\x00ed to conserve and promote all culturally, religiously and spiritually signi\\x00cant heritage  sites related to every faith in India and the ongoing PRASAD scheme will be expanded to achieve this  goal.   Conserving Bharatiya Linguistic Culture  03  We will constitute a National Task Force to study the status of all wri\\x00en and spoken languages and  dialects in India. We will also work towards revival and promotion of vulnerable or extinct dialects and  languages.   04 With  a  focussed  e\\x00o\\x00  on  promotion  of  Sanskrit,  we  will  ensure  that  the  teaching  of  Sanskrit  is  expanded  and  popularised  at  the  school  level.  We  will  also  provide  100  Panini  fellowships  to  researchers and scholars across India to promote research in Sanskrit.  Namami Gange: A ma\\x00er of Pride  05  We are commi\\x00ed to ensure a clean and uninterrupted \\x00ow of river Ganga from Gangotri to Ganga  Sagar.  We will ensure that the sewerage infrastructure to deal with 100% of the waste water from the  Ganga towns is completed and is functioning e\\x00ectively, and take steps to enhance the river \\x00ow.    06  The villages located on the banks of the river, which are already open defecation free, will be taken up  under a special project to ensure complete sustainable management of solid and liquid waste.    Sabarimala   07 We will unde\\x00ake every e\\x00o\\x00 to ensure that the subject of faith, tradition and worship rituals related  to Sabarimala are presented in a comprehensive manner before the Hon’ble Supreme Cou\\x00. We will  endeavour to secure constitutional protection on issues related to faith and belief.   Promoting Yoga Globally  08 We will fu\\x00her continue our e\\x00o\\x00s to promote Yoga globally as the world celebrates 21st June as the  International Yoga  Day. We  will  promote Yoga  as  a  vital  method  to  achieve  physical  wellness  and  spiritual rejuvenation across the globe and will continue to work towards training of Yoga practitioners.  We will unde\\x00ake a rapid expansion of Yoga health hubs, Yoga tourism and research in Yoga.   Bharatiya Cultural Festival  09  An International Cultural Festival will be organised on a grand scale every year in 5 di\\x00erent states to  showcase  and  promote  the  rich  diversity  of  Indian  culture  and  e\\x00o\\x00s  will  be  made  for  greater  pa\\x00icipation of Pravasi Bharatiya population and international community.    36  \\x0cDharohar Darshan  10  To  increase  accessibility  and  promote  all  culturally  and  historically  signi\\x00cant  heritage  sites  and  museums in India,  we will launch a web-enabled vi\\x00ual tour of all such locations through ‘Dharohar  Dharshan-an integrated web po\\x00al’. Eliminating the geographical boundaries, the po\\x00al will provide  real-time experience of Indian cultural heritage, accessible from any corner of the globe.  Uniform Civil Code  11  A\\x00icle 44 of the Constitution of India lists Uniform Civil Code as one of the Directive Principles of State  Policy. BJP believes that there cannot be gender equality till such time India adopts a Uniform Civil  Code, which protects the rights of all women, and the BJP reiterates its stand to dra\\x00 a Uniform Civil  Code, drawing upon the best traditions and harmonizing them with the modern times.  37  \\x0cForeign Policy  We believe that India’s time has come. She is emerging as a power and connecting stakeholders in a  multi-polar world. The rise of India is the new reality and we shall play a major role in shaping global  agenda in the 21st century.  ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’   01  While  pursuing  our  national  developmental  and  security  interests,  the  ancient  Indian  vision  of  ‘Vasudhaiva  Kutumbakam’  will form  the  basis  in  our  global  co-operation for  progress,  prosperity,  peace and security, especially with friendly countries and neighbours. Besides working to secure and  safeguard ‘global commons’, we will strengthen our role as ‘\\x00rst responder’ for disaster relief and  humanitarian assistance and develop pa\\x00nerships for disaster resilient infrastructure.  Global Coordination on Knowledge and Technology   02  We will make knowledge exchange and transfer of technology for the development of all countries a  major focus of our diplomatic relations. As a pa\\x00 of this, we will endeavour to create an ‘International  Space  Technology  Alliance’  for  be\\x00er  coordination  and  cooperation  on  issues  related  to  space  technology to ensure that the bene\\x00ts of space technology reach all, especially the smaller countries.  Continuous Dialogue with Indians Living Abroad   03 We will create an institutional mechanism to deepen the relationship of culture and heritage with  people of Indian origin, and to regularly engage with them. We will simultaneously launch ‘Bharat  Gaurav’ campaign to increase interaction among the Indian diaspora and enable their continuous  engagement with the Indian missions. We will strengthen the MADAD po\\x00al as single-point avenue for  information and services for Indians living abroad.  Combating Terrorism through Global Forums   04  We  are  commi\\x00ed  to  taking  concrete  steps  on  international  forums  against  countries  and  organizations suppo\\x00ing terrorism, and we will take all necessary measures to isolate such countries  and organizations on the global stage. To ensure the same, we will work towards establishing a ‘Comity  of Nations Against International Terrorism’ as a voluntary multi-lateral forum based on the principles of  the dra\\x00 Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism.  Deeper Multilateral Co-operation   05  We will e\\x00ectively pursue co-operation against global evils, such as terrorism and corruption through  forums like UN, the G20, BRICS, SCO, Commonwealth, etc. Signi\\x00cant interactions such as Russia- India-China  (RIC)  and  Japan-America-India  (JAI)  will  be  strengthened.  To  forward  our  ‘Neighbourhood  First’  policy,  we  will  extensively  leverage forums  such  as  BIMSTEC,  to  accelerate  regional  coordination  and  economic  co-operation  with  countries  in  our  neighbourhood. Act  East  Policy, cooperation with ASEAN and ensuring an open, inclusive, prosperous and secure Indo-Paci\\x00c  will be pursued vigorously.  Permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council   06  We are commi\\x00ed to seeking permanent membership of the United Nation Security Council so that  the body re\\x00ects the contemporary geopolitical realities of the world. We are determined to intensify  our e\\x00o\\x00s towards these objectives.  38  \\x0cStrengthening the Diplomatic Cadre and Outreach   07 We will increase the strength of the diplomatic and allied cadres to keep pace with our increasing  global  engagement  and  enhanced  stature  of  India  in  the  world.  In  addition,  we  will  facilitate  the  pa\\x00icipation of expe\\x00s in foreign policy-making through a robust mechanism. We will establish a full- \\x00edged University of Foreign Policy, the \\x00rst of its kind in the region, to focus on academic study and  research on foreign policy and geopolitical issues relevant to India and capacity building of our and  friendly foreign diplomats. India’s states will be actively assisted in their international outreach for  economic development.
